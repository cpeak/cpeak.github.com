    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Babylon Marketing site currently uses CraftCMS v2 enabling the team to create and update pages without additional dev help. Documentation for Craft v2 can be found <a href="https://docs.craftcms.com/v2/" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
    <p>The power of Craft is that it is extremely flexible and completely controlled by the user. The downside is that it's not a site builder or design tool. Everything has to be created by the user.</p>
