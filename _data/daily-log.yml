  progress: "Actually had quiet time to practice. Looked at scales a bit closer, getting faster with them and trying different practice techniques such as skipping notes and backing up to play 123 234 345, etc. Finally added that last note to the Travis finger picking technique. Very slow, innacurate, but working on it."
  status: "Gretsch still staying nicely in tune, just a touch flat. Feeling better, fingers getting more accurate, but need to work on bar chords to let all notes ring."
