  {
    "day": "January 3rd",
    "question": "What did you learn from last year?",

I'm human, I'm going to make mistakes, and I'd like to think I've made it this far in life without making such egregious mistakes that I couldn't repeat. I mean there's a lot of stuff from High School that I'd do differently, but c'mon, who wouldn't.",

  },
  {
    "day": "January 7th",
    "question": "How do you feel about second chances?",
    "answer": "For some situations absolutely, but look at intent. If you make a mistake, not a big deal, fix it and move on. But if the intent was bad, I don't like forgive and forget unless you have a good conversation about consequences of breaking trust again.",
    "additional": "Double play date, yikes a busy day. Sledding at Autumn Creek with Oliver, Cordelia, Alison, and Emma, then back to the house for hot chocolate. Got a roaring fire going, and then dinner and bedtime routine. "
