    "question": "What is your number one New Years resolution?",
    "answer": "Getting in shape really - I want to look awesome for Forest and Im already starting to get there. Watch the weight, eat healthier, and stick to working out as often as I can. Trying new foods, being more present, write better, keep the anger down.",
    "additional": "Started the New Year off right - K took the kids to Bryans and I stayed home for some relaxation. 3 hours of tripping, listening to music, and enjoying myself. Best trip yet I think."

    "question": "What do you want to be different about this year?",

  {
    "day": "January 3rd",
    "question": "What did you learn from last year?",
    "answer": "That I can actually stick to resolutions. I can have healthy boundaries and speak up for myself. I can take time for myself. To be present. I learned where I unfortunately got a lot of my mental health behaviors.",
    "additional": "Cut out pieces for the trooper helmet, worked, worked out, productive day."
  },
  {
    "day": "January 4th",
    "question": "What mistake do you vow to never make again?",
    "answer": "It sounds like a cop-out but I don't vow to never make any specific mistake again. I'm human, I'm going to make mistakes, and I'd like to think I've made it this far in life without making such egregious mistakes that I couldn't repeat. I mean there's a lot of stuff from High School that I'd do differently, but c'mon, who wouldn't.",
    "additional": "Working out yesterday strained something in my arm. Hurt like hell all day but feeling better now. Super tired from staying up too late last night."
  },
  {
    "day": "January 5th",
    "question": "What is something you've been procrastinating that you can't put off?",
    "answer": "Christmas cards. Its January and I still haven't got them out. At least I printed off the photos, and addressed the envelopes, but I still need to get everything done.",
    "additional": "Work, then therapy, home and chillin with Alison."
  },
  {
    "day": "January 6th",
    "question": "What do you need to make more time for?",
    "answer": "Me time. Karen and I have been working on this for ever. I don't get enough",
    "additional": "Super busy day but not bad. I actually did get some me time while Kendall took the girls to a birthday party. I figured out the surround sound issue with the PSVR in the basement, so next time I trip its going to be fucking amazing. Took the girls sledding, then Alison and I went to the Arboretum lights with Dad and Mary before hading to BDs for dinner."
