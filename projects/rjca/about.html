<p>JMA Associates, Inc. (JMA) was established to provide construction cost accounting services. This company is a successor to Joseph R. Munn &amp; Associates. Mr. Munn was previously employed with Morse Diesel International and Metropolitan Structures, Inc., as Manager of Project Cost Accounting. When Mr. Munn left Morse Diesel International and Metropolitan Structures, he saw the need for construction cost accounting services for owners, construction managers, general contractors, subcontractors and suppliers.</p>
<p>Changes in the construction industry have made concepts such as partnering and alliances more important in assuring the viability of construction and construction related business. There are no longer numerous other companies available to complete the project if the original contractor fails to perform. Accordingly, there has never been a time where the services provided by JMA have been as important as they are today.</p>
<p>The services provided by JMA are Construction Auditing Program, Off-Site Stored Material Verification, Project Financial Management and Construction Litigation Support. These Services are generally provided to owners, financial institutions, construction managers, general contractors, subcontractors and suppliers. These Services are highly specialized and tailored to meet the individual needs of the client. They assure that cost is controlled and managed, all accounts payable are appropriate, and that all financial terms and conditions of the contract/subcontracts are adhered to in a manner most beneficial to the client.</p>
