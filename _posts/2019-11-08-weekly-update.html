<h2>What I worked on</h2>
<p>This week was mostly spent wrapping up my current project, doing little design tweaks, and implementing feedback from the stakeholders. A few technical challenges were overcome, mainly dealing with StickyJS.</p>
<p>Another fun thing I did this week was create a little navigation link underline that spreads out from the center. I did it by adding a blank span after all the links, width at 0% and left 50%. On :hover I set it to width 100% and left 0% with a transition, giving the appearance of growing outwards, instead of whats actually happening - its shifting to the left at the same speed its going from 0 to 100% width. You can see the live example up in the navigation here, or in this exaggerated delay below.</p>
<div class="post-content-container">
  <span class="ex-grow-link">Example Link Animation<span></span></span>
</div>
<h2>Positive Notes</h2>
<p>Earlier this week Jen Simmons tweeted out <a href="https://twitter.com/MozDevNet/status/1192466998002954241" target="blank">a quick demonstration of new underline styles</a> that are coming in CSS. Right now the features has limited support in Safari and Firefox, and none in Chrome, IE/Edge, and others. We will have the ability to change the vertical offset, line color, thickness, style, and more. Im looking forward to this.</p>
<p>If you're in Chrome right now, this next sentence will look like a standard underline. If your browser supports it, it should be different. <span class="ex-underline-1">Underline with descenders q p and j</span>.</p>
<h2>Reflection</h2>
<p>Not a bad week, mainly just spent it head down and focused on work.</p>
<h2>What's next</h2>
<p>Heading back into the React world next week with my next client project. Its a small one, but should be fun. After that its a lot of PTO closer to the holidays - and in anticipation of that I picked up <i>Shoot For The Moon</i> by James Donovan, its a book about the space race and specifically the Apollo 11 mission.</p>
