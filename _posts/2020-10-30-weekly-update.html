<p>This was a challenging week, but I'm looking ahead to more positive things.</p>
<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>I'd say the biggest win was getting the recumbent in shape and out for more than a spin around the block. I was able to do a 14 mile round trip to the donut store and back. I was also able to get the kitchen pantry drawers installed, and started the edge banding to clean it all up. I'll share some photos next week.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>The big challenges this week were all work related, there was a few turbulent few days on my client project. Things were shifting fast, and there were a number of frankly very frustrating days. I powered through and believe things will get better, gotta stay positive.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I don't know if it will be 2021, but I really would love to do <a href="https://ragbrai.com" target="blank">RAGBRAI</a>. It's the Register's Annual Great Bike Ride Across Iowa, where 20k bike riders go from the Missouri River east to the Mississippi River, having fun along the way. 7 full days will be difficult, but I'd love to go one of these years.</p>
