<p>This week I am setting some personal and professional goals, the largest of which is a target I want to hit in the spring of 2020. In order to get there and grow as a crafter we identified that I should work on improving my communication skills, initiative, and more clearly define what value I can provide to 8th Light.</p>
<p>I love reading about space exploration and all things NASA, so naturally I tore through <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Astronauts-Guide-Life-Earth-Determination/dp/0316253030/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1533302955&sr=8-1&keywords=chris+hadfield&dpID=511UE0Uq4KL&preST=_SY291_BO1,204,203,200_QL40_&dpSrc=srch" target="blank">Chris Hadfield's <i>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</i></a> which is a wonderful book I recommend whole heartedly. One chapter caught my attention in particular when it comes to work and professional life. In the chapter Chris talks about how to be a zero.</p>
<h3>Aim to be a zero</h3>
<blockquote>...any new situation...you will almost certainly be viewed in one of three ways. As a <strong>minus one</strong>: actively harmful, someone who creates problems. Or as <strong>a zero</strong>: your impact is neutral and doesn't tip the balance on way or the other. Or you'll be seen as <strong>a plus one</strong>: someone who actively adds value.</blockquote>
<blockquote>If you enter a new environment intent on exploding out of the gate, you risk wreaking havoc instead. ... When you have some skills but don't fully understand your environment, there is no way you can be a plus one.</blockquote>
<p>Okay, I really wanted to write about this but I think this is going to be a very valuable and long post, so I'm going to sit on it for now and dedicate some time to fleshing it out. More about that, possibly on 8thlight.com</p>

<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>Talking to some people here we realized that if I was to become more of an expert in React front end development I could be more valuable to the company, so I am diving in headfirst. I spun up my first project and am going to run through the first tutorial to make a simple tic-tac-toe game which should be a lot of fun. For a long time we've had apprentice candidates write tic-tac-toe to demonstrate their skill level, so I think it will be fun to see what they go through.</p>
<p>I spent an hour or so walking through most of the game tutorial and it wasn't too difficult, but there are some concepts in there that I had to wrap my head around. I always heard the developers talking about immutability but never knew what it meant until now. I want to walk through it a few more times to get a good handle on concepts like passing props and functional components, but all in all so far its not super confusing!</p>

<p>I got a little sidetracked at first because they don't expect you to do any CSS and just work on bare button elements in the browser. As a designer I just can't do that, so I made my working environment much more friendly to the eyes (and accessible to boot!).</p>
<h3>Small thing I learned while writing this</h3>
<p>Out of habit I always hit <code>I</code> in VIM to jump to the beginning of the line, however that switches into edit mode so I would have to hit escape. Same with <code>A</code> for the end. Today I learned that <code>0</code> puts the cursor at the beginning and <code>$</code> goes to the end without entering edit mode. That saves me from hitting escape which really helps now that I am on a TouchBar equipped Mac.</p>
<h3>Lightning Talks</h3>
<p>We occasionally do Lightning Talks at work, just 5 minutes each where crafters can get up and talk about whatever they want to. Today we had a fun group, covering topics like Henry VIII (and why he was so awful), fountain pens, renaissance words and grammar, painting, and why you learn the recorder in grade school. I always find these fascinating and it's always fun to hear what my teammates are passionate about when they aren't at work.</p>
<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>Okay, I learned a LOT this week, but since its Friday afternoon and my brain is shutting down for the weekend I'll keep it simple. From Katrina's talk I learned that the 'Ye' in things like 'Ye olde shoppe' is an evolution of a letter form which originally looked kind of like a p, but was pronounced <strong>th</strong> and eventually evolved into being written as Y. Thus when an e is added <i>should</i> be pronounced as "<i>the</i>", not "<i>yee</i>". I butchered that explanation, but its hard to do that without writing it out to explain it.</p>
