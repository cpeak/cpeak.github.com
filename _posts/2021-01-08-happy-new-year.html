<p>Happy New Year everyone! I'm back at my desk and ready to kick off 2021. Despite 2020 being so crazy I was able to stick to my goal of doing weekly blog posts, and only missed two or three weeks only because of being out on vacation (looks like the final tally was 44 entries). I hope to keep up with weekly posts again this year, but will hopefully write a bit more. I found a lot of weeks I was just going through the motions to get something out, and didn't really write anything of substance. Maybe weekly posts and a well written post once a month or so. We'll see how it goes.</p>
<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Just getting through the week. Wednesday I had to take a mental health break after the chaos erupted in Washington, there was no way I could focus on work with everything going on. Just making it through the week feels like a win.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Just staying focused with the news streaming in. I have lots of thoughts but nothing I feel like sharing right now.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I don't have anything to link right now, its been difficult to just get back into the flow of working after taking more than 2 weeks off. I did however put clipless pedals on the recumbent, so I'm learning how to ride while locked into the bike which is fun. It wasn't nearly as scary as I had thought it would be, I was able to unclip very quickly. Hopefully it warms up so I can go for more than a ride around the neighborhood and get a better feel for using them.</p>
