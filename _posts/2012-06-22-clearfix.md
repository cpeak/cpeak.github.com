<h2>Quick Tip - clearfix</h2>
<p>One problem a lot of people run into with CSS is a collapsing container div. If you have a div which contains a number of sub-sections that are all set to <code>float</code> then the parent div collapses on itself because its children are not inside the normal flow. I have seen a number of hacks and ugly fixes, but here is one I have seen in various forms over the past year or so. Simply add a <code>.clearfix</code> class to the container div, then using CSS append an empty string set to <code>display: none;</code> at the end. </p>
<p><code>.clearfix:after {<br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;content: ""; </br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;visibility: hidden; <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;display: block; <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;height: 0; <br />
   &nbsp;&nbsp;clear: both;<br />
}</code></p>
<p>Pretty easy.</p>
<h2>But wait! There's more!</h2>
<p>Just when I thought I had a neat fix <a href="http://themergency.com/css-clearfix-demystified/">Nicolas Gallagher</a> swoops in and makes it even better. <strong><em>micro</em>clearfix</strong>. Same solution, much more concise:</p>
<p><code>.cf:before, .cf:after { content: ""; display: table; }<br />
.cf:after { clear: both; }<br />
.cf { zoom: 1; }<br />
</code></p>
