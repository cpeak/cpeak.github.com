<p>I joined Facebook sometime in 2006 and while it was fun for while, these days I find almost no reason to open it up and peruse my feed other than it's habit at this point. My 'news' feed has become clogged with completely useless junk that I don't want to see. I may be a bit of a crumudgeon, but I don't want to see what strangers are posting, I don't really care if a friend likes a brand or product, and I absolutely will not click on anything with 'You Won't Believe...' in the title.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wondered if I could somehow (loosely) track the number of valuable posts vs the garbage, so I opened a spreadsheet and catagorized the first 99 posts in my feed. I sat on it for a while just thinking about it and nothing came from it.</p>

<p>I wanted at least one more data set, so I went through the same exercise a couple of days ago and started putting more thought into it. I thought about how to categorize posts in order to assess value to them, breaking them out into these sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ads</li>
  <li>Like/comment/tag in Friend of Friend (i.e. Strangers) post</li>
  <li>Shared junk article</li>
</ul>
