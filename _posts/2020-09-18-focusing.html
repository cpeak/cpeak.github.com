<h2>This week's win</h2>
<p>I've been meaning to switch this blogs code repo over from using Master to defaulting to Main for a while now. I did some quick searching and found <a href="https://stevenmortimer.com/5-steps-to-change-github-default-branch-from-master-to-main/" target="blank">a well written and simple blog post</a> by Steven Mortimer. After reading his post, it took me about a minute to make the change and everything worked smoothly. The only gotcha was that when I deleted master, that temporarily disabled Github Pages which is built from master. It didn't automatically pick up the cutover and my site went down about five minutes after the switch. I had a hunch it was still looking for master so I checked the Pages GitHub Pages control panel and sure enough it had actually disabled it. I simply selected Main, clicked save, and my site came back online within about 10 seconds.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Accessibility checks, battling lighthouse.</p>
<h2>Something I found interesting</h2>
<p>Something random and fun.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I usually don't like all these &quot;One Div&quot; or &quot;One Line&quot; articles, but <a href="https://web.dev/one-line-layouts/" target="blank">this One Line Layouts</a> article was pretty handy. The headline is a bit click-baity since you  can't have an entire layout in one line, but I may just be a grouch.</p>
