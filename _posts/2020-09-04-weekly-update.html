<h2>What I worked on:</h2>
<p>I got tripped up working on a simple contact page. I whipped up a fun design where a headline has an array of adjectives that it swaps in and out. The big problem was our Circle CI Lighthouse plugin was flagging the fade-in/fade-out animation as not passing accessibility standards for color contrast. On top of that, I learned if you have a span in a headline, VoiceOver on iOS stops reading when it hits the span, reads whats in it and stops, and then continues afterwards. I'm still wrestling with it and its 4pm on Friday. I got it to the point where Lighthouse was passing locally but when I opened my PR it failed on the server side check. I'm about to throw my laptop out the window.</p>
<h2>What I learned:</h2>
<p>I spent some time on Wednesday testing VoiceOver on iOS, using it to navigate both websites and the iPhone itself. I highly recommend anyone who develops websites or applications to give it a try. It is enlightening to interact with technology from a visually impaired perspective.</p>
<h2>Positive notes:</h2>
<p>Its a three day weekend and the weather is perfect. I hope I don't spend it working on the basement, but we'll see...</p>
