<p>I've now spent a full week with the Macbook Pro and so far I am loving it. There are a few little things I have to get used to, but overall its a wonderful machine.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>This was the smoothest setup of a new system I have ever had, I was literally up and running within maybe 2 hours. I never transfer over settings or data on the initial setup, I prefer a clean system to migrate only what I absolutely need. Looking back this is my fifth Apple laptop, so I have a good sense of what I need and what I don't. The only problems I ran into was a small mis-configuration of my PATH variable, but I had that worked through quickly. I took a bit too long customizing my VIM color scheme settings, but I think that was worth it.</p>
<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>
<p>The new laptop is noticeably lighter than my 2015 MBP, but not by a whole lot. The screen looks beautiful, and the keyboard is better than I expected. I am loving the feel of it, the keys feel much more solid. The thing I was worried the most about was the TouchBar escape key, and how there was no actual key there. Since I use VIM for my development I had some serious trepidation about it, but while its jarring to top nothing, I think I'll get used to it once my muscle memory gets it down. The problem is there is no feedback for hitting the key - since I can't feel it I have no idea if it registered or not.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>
<p>Surprisingly one issue I am having is the trackpad - its so damn big! To right-click I have it set to the lower right corner of the trackpad. My issue now is that where I lay my hands by default the corner of the trackpad is under the center of my right wrist. I have to physically list and move my hand now. Before I cloud just roll my hand a little bit and curl my thumb under. Additionally while two-finger scrolling I absentmindedly leave my pinky down and before it was off the trackpad and now its on, causing some fun problems. All of this is muscle memory more than anything else so I am sure I'll get used to everything.</p>
<p><strong>The Ugly</strong></p>
<p>I really miss MagSafe for the power adapter. Yes, USB-C is nice and being able to use either side for power is cool, but I still think MagSafe was one of the best things Apple ever designed. The other issue I really can't fault the new laptop for, is I can no longer use my 30" Cinema display. USB-C -> Mini DisplayPort -> Dual Link DVI (all through stock Apple adapters) doesn't work. I read online that it can be done with specific adapters but I don't want to jump through a whole bunch of hoops, its time to retire my favorite display.</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a great machine and as long as the keyboard holds up I think I am going to get quite a few years out of it. They announced the repair program literally two days after we ordered it, so at least if it fails Ill get a free fix. Hopefully I feel this optimistic in a few months, we'll see...</p>
<p><strong>Something I learned this week</strong></p>
<p>Probably a few things, but when writing blog posts I got tired of copying text out of the browser and pasting in TextEdit to run a spell check so I finally figured out how to do it in VIM. Simply type <code>:set spell</code> and I can easily see everything I mis-typed (which I never do, yeah thats it). To turn off, just simply enter <code>:set nospell</code>. Pretty handy.</p>
