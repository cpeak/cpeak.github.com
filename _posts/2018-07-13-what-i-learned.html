<p>I am continuing my push for writing more and hopefully improving. This week I started working on a fun side project with my best friend written in NodeJS and Pug, as well as an intensive day with the vinyl cutter.</p>

<h3>Node JS + Pug</h3>
<p>My best friend had a great idea for a simple app and wanted some design help. I dove head first into the project however it was just a single nodejs file as a functionality demo that needed to be properly developed. He chose to implement using the <a href="https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html" target="blank">Pug JS</a> template engine which I had never heard of before. It seems similarly to HAML where it strips the tedious closing tags and simplifies writing code. I couldn't quite get the app to render through the engine but I was able to scaffold out my <a href="https://www.xfive.co/blog/itcss-scalable-maintainable-css-architecture/" target="blank">ITCSS</a> structure and do some front-end setup while he gets the view templates in order. Should be a great project and I can't wait to share it when we get some more work done.</p>
<h3>The Vinyl Cutter</h3>
<p>Our LA office requested a metric ton of decals for their windows, so I bought a bunch of vinyl and went to work Wednesday morning. They wanted 6 12"x12" 8th Light logo decals and 6 12"x12" PolyglotLA logo decals for an event coming up that's being hosted there, so I put on my headphones and got into a good flow. I find that I am much faster at working and know the little things to look out for when working with the vinyl cutter, so I surprised myself when I finished up everything by about lunchtime.</p>
<p>One thing I think I did really well was using the vinyl efficiently. Since the Polyglot LA logos aren't square there was a considerable amount of space below on each 12"x12" sheet, so I used that space to make smaller laptop size decals, that way I wasn't wasting vinyl or creating a bunch of small scrap pieces that would be hard to use in the future.</p>

<h3>How's the writing going?</h3>
<p>Well if we're being honest it's Saturday the 14th, and so far since I sat down an hour ago to write this post I now have a loaf of cinnamon raisin bread in the bread machine, I vacuumed the living room, I synced my photos and cleaned up some files on my Mac, and tinkered around with the blog previews on the index page. Not the best, but hey, it's a process right? I need to start figuring out a productive writing environment which at work is challenging, and at home even more so since I have a 4 year old running around. But I'm sticking with it!</p>
<h3>The New Macbook</h3>
<p>I called it! Just over two weeks after ordering this one the new Macbooks were released. It figures. Not the end of the world, I think its kinda funny. But so far I am still really enjoying the new system. Some people are saying if you bought a Macbook within two weeks of the release of the new ones you can go to the Apple Store and try to get a new model, but I think I am just outside that window, plus I don't think its quite worth the hassle. Now we'll see if this keyboard holds up...</p>
<p>One thing that really helps is the <a href="https://www.haptictouchbar.com" target="blank">Haptic Touch Bar</a> app, which makes the Touch Bar 'click' when you hit keys. I was skeptical of it at first but once I found you can increase the force of the click it really helped. At the default level 3 I found I wasn't quite feeling the clicks every time. I bumped it to 4 which is the max and it feels much better.</p>
