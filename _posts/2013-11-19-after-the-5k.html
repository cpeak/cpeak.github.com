title: After the 5K
category : blog
---
<p>So a few weeks ago I ran my first 5K which I am rather proud of. I have done a few before, but they were with my wife and friends, so we didn't fully run them. The SCNA 5K I ran the whole way without stopping, which was my only goal. Turns out I finished exactly in the middle of the pack (it was a small race of 25 guys from our conference), with a completion time of 27:50. Not too shabby for my first.</p>

<p>The race went better than expected because I hadn't run in a few weeks. I started way too fast and the Nike run app informed me my first mile was done in around 8:30 which is a full minute faster than my normal pace. I knew that wasn't sustainable so I slowed down and just kept going. The last half-mile or so were the worst, thankfully I pushed myself and finished.</p>
<p>Now I'd like to step up my game and maybe do a 5K in 25 minutes or so, or possibly start training for a 10K. I haven't decided yet, but when I do Ill start tracking my progress here.</p>
