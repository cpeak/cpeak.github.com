<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>I took a long weekend for Memorial Day to take some time having fun with the family. It was definitely strange to have people over to the house and just relax like everything is normal. I know there's no returning to &quot;normal&quot;, but it's still going to take some time to get to whatever the new normal will be.</p>
<p>I also took a 50 mile ride from Oswego to St Charles and back, testing the Insta360 camera along the way. I'll share some video once I edit it down, but after my initial look I am disappointed in the quality. I <i>think</i> it's because I had a lower class SD card in the camera so the quality took a hit because it couldn't keep up with recording 5.7k @30fps. Although I freely admit I don't know a ton about video, so there could easily be some user error in there.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Client work this week was a bit difficult because two of their virtual servers we've been running our application on went down at inopportune times. So we had to scramble to setup a dedicated server to get our external user testing completed on time.<p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>This week I learned about cyclist Gino Bartali, who was a renowned Italian cyclist during the second world war, where he <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gino_Bartali#Rescues_and_Resistance_role_during_World_War_II" target="blank">used his fame to support the Italian resistance, hiding a Jewish family in his cellar and smuggling documents</a>, saving countless lives. What jumped out most for me was he never boasted about it, long afterwards saying:</p>
<quote>The good is done, but it is not said. And certain medals hang on the soul, not on the jacket</quote>
<p>I love that quote so much.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Obviously we've been at home since May of last year, but on top of that I have taken exactly 0 hours of PTO this year. Now that things are opening back up, we just booked an AirBnB in Connecticut to visit family for the first time since 2019. We're really looking forward to driving out and spending a week on the coast, playing at the beach, soaking up the sun, and eating way too much seafood.</p>
