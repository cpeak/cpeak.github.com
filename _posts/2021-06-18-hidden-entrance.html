<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Big win at work - we got rave reviews from my client and they signed us on for at least another six months, and are looking to add another two developers. We'll review the contract again at the end of the year but for now everyone is very happy. Feels good to have work locked in for that long, I don't like being in between projects.</p>
<p>Another big win was that I started working on the hidden bookcase entrance to my home theater, framing out the basic structure of everything using 1x12 pre-primed pine. This weekend I need to get some castors and a piano hinge to get the &quot;door&quot; hung, and then I'll drill for shelf pins. After that (probably next week) I'll add the top piece when I determine my crown molding height, then tack in the backing and trim, fill the holes and give it a good coat of paint. Last step is to figure out some kind of latch and pull for it, most likely a book that tilts forwards.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Work went very smoothly, so the biggest challenge was putting together the bookcase frame. I mis-measured the width of the swinging door so I had to go back and trim down the width a bit to make sure it swung inwards clearing the shelf next to it while still looking like one entire bookcases. Still lots to do...</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>It's Fathers Day weekend, so I plan on relaxing as much as I can and hanging out with the family, then back to work on shelving and finishing the basement. Things are progressing nicely.</p>
