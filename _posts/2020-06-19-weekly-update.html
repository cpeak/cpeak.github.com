<h2>What I worked on:</h2>
<p>The project at work continues, and is gaining steam. We're knocking out more and more features quicker than ever. Thursday was a lot of fun because I did my first round of interviews with the agents who will be actually using the system. It was reassuring to hear that the major parts of the app are in place and most of the feedback was about small details and adjustments.</p>
<p>I was also able to spend some time out in the garage on Monday night putting together my workbench. It still needs a top since I can't transport full sheets of plywood, but I'll figure that out soon. Next up is a rolling base for the table saw that will raise it up to the height of the bench so it can act as an out-feed table as well.</p>

<h2>What I learned:</h2>
<p>I was aware that wood is never perfectly straight but I learned how even slight warping can really impact putting things together. One of the legs on the workbench had a slight bow to it and it really threw off how the two pieces fit together. Thankfully I was extra careful so everything came out square, but its not the prettiest thing in the world.</p>
<h2>Positive notes:</h2>
<p>I signed up for a Hey.com invite back on February 6th when they announced it, and I finally got access on Thursday. I haven't spent a lot of time using it, but immediately you can tell how much thought and care was put into it. Email is one of those things I've used for so long and just gotten used to how awful it is. I'll share my thoughts on it once I have some more time with it.</p>
<p>My 40" x 30" canvas prints came in and wow, they are beautiful. One of them is my favorite capture of the International Space Station about to transit the moon. I can't wait to see it up on the wall.</p>
