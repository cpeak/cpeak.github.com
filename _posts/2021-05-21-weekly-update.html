<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>We had our first round of internal user testing with the client app we've been working on for a month or so now, and while there were some infrastructure hiccups, I think it went very well. We're already seeing some positive notes about the direction we're working on and getting some reinforcement that it's the correct path. One test does not make conclusions though, so we have some more scheduled next week.</p>
<p>Also my Insta360 arrived and I was able to unbox it and poke around a little bit, I'll share a full write up when I actually get the hang of using it. My immediate impressions are that it's really well built, and much lighter than I was expecting. Fun to use, and there's a slight learning curve, but I was able to get things setup and recording without any stumbling blocks.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Like I mentioned above, just some infrastructure issues with our client's servers. For our prototype to work, we need to connect to one of two servers, and if they go down, user testing is out the window. Things changed on one of them unbeknownst to us, so that kinda messed a few things up. Thankfully next week it sounds like we're getting our own prototyping server to make sure things are stable for testing.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Next week is going to be spent by doing some more user tests, and hopefully getting out on the bike and shooting some ride videos. Should be a lot of fun.</p>
