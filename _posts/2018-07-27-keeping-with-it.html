<p>This week was spent ramping up and starting work on a new project at work that uses Elixer, Erlang, Node, and something really interesting to me, <a href="https://storybook.js.org/" target="blank">Storybook</a> which is a UI development environment. I've done two projects in <a href="https://fractal.build/" target="blank">Fractal</a>, a pattern library, but Storybook seems much more complex and powerful. I still build the UI pieces and feed them data, but the developers are directly building the application using the components I construct. Monday was a bit confusing, Tuesday I felt a little better, and by Wednesday I was working on stories.</p>
<p>Im trying to keep up with the weekly blog posts, and find myself setting more reminders to get shit done. There is a significant goal I want to hit in about 18 months, and I am already starting to break it down into pieces to make sure I hit it with time to spare. More on that later...</p>

<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>Most of my time was spent wrapping my head around Storybook, but I had a small moment yesterday where I was refactoring a radio button and came up with a cleaner solution which I always really like. Over the past few years front end developers have been obsessed with replacing every default browser <code>input</code> element with something custom, which of course is horribly hacked together and typically not very accessible (that could be a series of blog posts on its own). I was working on a simple Radio input, which had a <code>:before</code> block sitting above the actual button itself. When the radio button was clicked and active, it would use CSS to insert a circle character to display that it was aactivated. The problem there is its really figity - it had a font size of something like 3.41rem and a line height of .43, it wasn't quite centered so it had the googly eye look. Not good. In order to fix it that way you really had to tweak things, use weird position calls, ugh, just not good.</p>
<p>After futzing with it for about ten minutes I had a  Joey Tribbiani moment where I just said "there's gotta be a better way!". Then a little voice in my head* whispered "box shadow inset". Why render a character in that and try to get it perfectly in place? Just set the background color, and use an inset box shadow of 4px set to white. That way its perfectly circular, there's no positioning issues, no font size issues, nothing. Clean. Simple. I like it.</p>

<h4>Prepending SCSS files with an _</h4>
<p>I think this was a week or two ago, but I had a boneheaded move on another project. I setup a new scss file and was getting compile errors when calling variables. I scratched my head because other SASS functions like nesting and internal variables were working. I realized I forgot to prepend the filename with an underscore, which tells SASS that the file is going to be imported into another place, and needs to access global variables. :facepalm:</p>
<h4>Illustrator Shape Builder Tool</h4>
<p>Okay, I've had this one down for a while now, but I still am in love with the Shape Builder tool in Adobe Illustrator. It lets you slice and combine compound paths so quickly and easily it still blows my mind. Lets look at the PolyGlot LA logo I was working on a few weeks ago. I had a type layer, a container box and a really thick border box around it, all different shapes.</p>
<p>I select everything I want to combine into a single item, hit <code>Shift + M</code> for the builder tool, and then click where I what I want to add. If I want to combine two separate parts I click and drag a path between the two. If I want to cut out something (like the letters), I shold shift and remove it.</p>

<p>Using the shape builder tool I can cut out pieces I don't want, and combine shapes into one single piece, that way in the end I have one simple, clean, and uniform compound shape. I can change colors with one click, and if I want it two colors I just use the paint bucket and fill in the empty spaces. Additionally I can feed it into the vinyl cutter and make really slick decals.</p>
