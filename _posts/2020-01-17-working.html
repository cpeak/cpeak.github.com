<h2>What I worked on</h2>
<p>Helping out with some internal projects, spun up a React project just to experiment with simplifying a really complex table. End of the week was a bit rough, I spun up an old client project but then Thursday night barely slept because of a cranky baby, so Friday was a PTO day.</p>
<h2>Positivity</h2>
<p>I've been keeping up with my 365 challenge of playing my new guitar every day and trying to steadily improve over the year. Im keeping a log which seems to be helping, leaving myself notes about things I am working on and how my progress is going.</p>
