<p>I've seen lots of tweets these past few days about whether or not sites should work with or without Javascript. Lots of people writing that websites should be HTML + CSS, some advocating for HTML + CSS with Javascript enhancements, and others who argue that Javascript is a core piece of the front end stack and those who turn it off should get what they deserve.</p>
<p>When I started writing websites back in the 90s it was HTML and that was it. I remember when CSS was introduced.</p>
<p>Let's get real here: we aren't typical internet users, and the faster you realize that, the quicker the web is going to be a better place. Yes, the average user is never going to disable Javascript, but that's not the point. The point is the end user shouldn't have to download a 150Mb blob of crap laden with tracking scripts and analytics tools just to see your three page marketing site. Users with visual impairments shouldn't be subjected to a minefield of auto-generated divs 100 levels deep.</p>
