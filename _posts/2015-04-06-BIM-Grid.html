<p>Experimenting with a BIM based grid system. Previous grids were structured based on a row/column-x based approach, but a class of column-ten only applies to the desktop, so the markup was incorrect at different sizes. Using this approach all columns default to 100% width on mobile (first), and then a class is applied for each breakpoint - in this case 2, medium and large.</p>
<p>In this example we have a div that on mobile by default is 100% width, at a medium breakpoint (<code>m--</code>) it spans half the row, while at the largest (<code>l--</code>) and beyond it spans two thirds the row.</p>
<p><code>&lt;div class="block__m--half l--two-thirds"&gt;</code></p>
<p>Every div must have at least the <code>block</code> class, but it is not necessary to have a medium or large class assigned to it. It will just default to 100% if nothing is defined. Also, if the medium breakpoint size applies to the large layout as well, no additional class definition is needed.</p>

<h3>Standard Grid</h3>
<p>Here is a standard grid example. Grey is the default size, blue is the medium breakpoint, and red is the large. Each block only has a <code>m--</code> class size defined, since they do not change at the large size.</p>
<p>Blocks are defined <code>block__m--full</code>, <code>block__m--third</code>, etc..</p>
<div class="example grid__container">
  <div class="block__m--full">Full</div>

  <div class="block__m--half">Half</div>
  <div class="block__m--half">Half</div>

  <div class="block__m--third">Third</div>
  <div class="block__m--third">Third</div>
  <div class="block__m--third">Third</div>

  <div class="block__m--fourth">Fourth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fourth">Fourth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fourth">Fourth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fourth">Fourth</div>

  <div class="block__m--fifth">Fifth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fifth">Fifth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fifth">Fifth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fifth">Fifth</div>
  <div class="block__m--fifth">Fifth</div>

  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
  <div class="block__m--sixth">Sixth</div>
</div>

<h3>Different Breakpoints</h3>
<p>Here is a grid where some of the elements change at different breakpoints. Again, by default they are all full, but if we look at the second line - at a medium breakpoint, it is split half and half, while at the large breakpoint its two-thirds/one-third. The two blocks are defined as so:</p>
<p><code>block__m--half l--two-thirds</code></p>
<p><code>block__m--half l--one-third</code></p>
<p>Looking down to the bottom, they are set to thirds on medium, but sixths on large. </p>
<div class="example grid__container">
  <div class="block__m--full">Full</div>

  <div class="block__m--half l--two-thirds">Multi</div>
  <div class="block__m--half l--third">Multi</div>

  <div class="block__m--third l--fourth">Multi</div>
  <div class="block__m--third l--fourth">Multi</div>
  <div class="block__m--third l--fourth">Multi</div>

  <div class="block__m--full">Full</div>

  <div class="l--fourth block__m--third">Fourth/Third</div>
  <div class="l--fourth block__m--third">Fourth/Third</div>
  <div class="l--fourth block__m--third">Fourth/Third</div>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
    <div class="block__l--sixth m--third">Third/Sixth</div>
  </div>
</div>
<h2>Thoughts so far...</h2>
<p>I haven't used this system in production yet as its still mainly just a thought experiment. I also haven't done any conditionals where you may want to float blocks to the right, or centered, thats on the list if I like where this is headed.</p>
<h3>Pros</h3>
<p>I like the idea of a semantic markup that represents the layout of content across multiple breakpoints. Ideally I won't have to fiddle with widths or floats or any ugly hacks using this system. Its also warming me to the idea of using a BIM style convention, as I haven't used that on a large scale before. However...</p>
<h3>Cons</h3>
<p>I almost want to put an asterisk on the semantic comment from above. Yes, it is, but it also isn't as one class isn't used at every size. It also clogs up the markup a little bit. However when I use this only on an as-needed basis and not on every element in the layout then its not too bad (again, in my experimentation).</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Okay, no conclusion yet. I plan on building a rough site using this method to shake it down and see if it's feasable to use in the real world. I'm not exactly racing off to try it, but I am cautiously optimistic. Ill provide a few followup posts as I continue this experiment.</p>
