<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>We're still making great progress on the client app, and I'm getting more comfortable working in Angular. We're hoping to spend next week getting ramped up and ready for real world user testing which is exciting, so we're going to focus on refining all the steps we want to go over in those tests.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Nothing too bad this week, however I did have one of those facepalm moments. The developer on the project and I were pairing, trying to track down why a certain toolbar was not showing up. He had worked on it for a while, then pinged me to talk through some ideas. We spent probably 15 or 20 minutes trying to figure out what was happening and the whole time I had something stuck in the back of my brain that I was forgetting something I did a few weeks ago. Long story short I had set a <code>display: none</code> on the toolbar while overhauling the layout. I deleted that one line of code, let out some choice swear words, and then moved on.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I was listening to one of my favorite podcasts <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/we-choose-to-go-to-the-moon-part-1/id1471188269?i=1000444360842" target="blank">What We Saw</a> which starts off with four episodes focused on the Apollo program. In one, the host talks about Apollo 12 and how it was hit by lightning not once, but twice as it lifted off, leading to one of the greatest examples of problem solving ever seen, the <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/98484/this-day-in-space-history-apollo-12-and-sce-to-aux/" target="blank">SCE to Aux</a> solution. Talk about averting disaster.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>It's almost a month ago that I got my first COVID shot, and I'm looking forward to scheduling my second. From the looks of it I should be able to book an appointment next Friday or soon thereafter. Hopefully round 2 goes better than some people, I'm hoping since I had a reaction to the first dose I'll be good after the second but I'm not super optimistic. Worth it though...</p>
