<p>A difficult week at the client, but trying to stay positive.</p>
<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Back in high school and college I used to ride my trusty Linear recumbent all summer long, but for a few years it's been hanging up in my dads garage collecting dust. He finally dropped it off at the house, and I was able to get everything reassembled and in working order. I need to adjust the derailleurs and brakes, but other than that its as good as new. That's especially hard to believe since I first got it I believe in the summer of 1995. For being 25 years old its held up like a tank. I'm hoping to get a few rides in before it gets cold, and then next year do some long distance riding.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Work was extra challenging this week as the client pivoted a few times and we've been trying to hit a moving target. Despite this I made a big push today to get some solid work in and will start on a positive note Monday.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I'm trying to be better about setting goals and making plans, so for long distance riding I'm looking at <a href="https://www.railstotrails.org/trailblog/2013/october/28/rtcs-list-of-the-top-10-trails-in-illinois/" target="blank">bike trails in Illinois</a> and a <a href="https://cycle.travel/" target="blank">really neat bike trip planning tool.</a>. I really hope I can get some rides in before it gets too cold. C'mon weather!</p>
