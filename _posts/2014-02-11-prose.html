<p>Apparently Prose is a CRUD interface for Jekyll powered blogs on GitHub. This is a test post to see how this works.</p>
<p>Update: I can now create, edit, and delete anything in the project using <a href="http://prose.io">Prose.io</a>. The save/publish function isn't the clearest, but once I figure this out it could be a handy tool.</p>
