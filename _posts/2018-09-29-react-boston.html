<p>After coming back from vacation I dove head first into client work to get a project over the finish line so I didn't really devote much time to learning React or even Waza time. It's been a tough few weeks but now things are settling down and I find myself in Boston, MA to attend React Boston. It's a 2 day conference mainly aimed at developers but there are a few talks that look really intriguing as a designer. One is a talk about designing a component kit which sounds awesome, there's one about custom CSS and an inconsistent UI, one about faster UI's, and quite a few more. I don't think I'll be over my head for most of em, we'll see how it goes.</p>

<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>Its going to take a while for everything to sink in and I can't wait to see the talk videos when they are posted, that way I can pause and Google things without missing a ton of the talks. I followed along quite well, only getting lost a few times when they were talking about GraphQL as I don't have any exposure to it yet.</p>
<p>The first day was a lot of fun, a great mix of technical talks with some about process and higher views of software development. Day 2 started off with Josh Comeau making the case for more "whimsy" on the internet which I whole heartedly agree, and was followed by another full day of great speakers.</p>

<h3>What I got this week</h3>
<p>After a long two week wait plus a detour through Pennsylvania my new iPhone Xs Max finally arrived just a few hours before I took off for Boston. This is the first iPhone I pre-ordered at 2am when the orders opened, and it's the first iPhone since the original that feels really exciting and magical.</p>
<p>Getting used to having no home button took a lot less time than I expected. I only found my thumb hitting the bottom of the screen and waiting for the fingerprint reater twice, which is not too bad. FaceID is magical. Most of the time I don't even see the lock switch to open, I just swipe up and it works. The only time it hasn't worked is when I wake up in the morning, apparently my habit is to look at my phone with one eye squinched shut which FaceID doesn't like.</p>
<p>The camera is absolutely amazing. After the conference instead of the after party I headed up to Portland Maine and caught the sunrise at the famous Portland Head Light, which had been on my photography bucket list for years. This shot is straight off the iPhone, scaled down a little bit.</p>

<p>I'm not a selfie kind of guy so I won't be testing that, but I'll be sure to try out Portrait Mode with my daughter when I get back home. I have a Canon 5D MkIII and a 70-200mm 2.8 so it has some tough competition - we'll see how it handles itself. Judging by the results I am expecting a good fight.</p>
