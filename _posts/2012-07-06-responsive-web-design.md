<h2>Responsive Web Design</h2>
<p>There has been a revolution in the past 5 years when it comes to how we consume online content. In that short amount of time, most of us carry around an internet-capable device in our back pocket. My commute invovles taking the Metra into Chicago every day, and looking around the train in the morning its easy to see this in action. This morning I count 12 iPhones, 9 iPads, 3 Android phones, and one Android tablet.  While this sample size is small and certainly not representative, it is very interesting.  At least half of the people on the train have some kind of smartphone or tablet.
