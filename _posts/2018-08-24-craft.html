<p>This week I dove back into the world of Craft CMS after a brief break between engagements. Its interesting, after just a few weeks spent learning React on and off, walking back into Craft CMS things were clicking in my head a bit faster in terms of data structure and putting together view templates. Building the templates in Craft is a bit of a chore because you have to write everything from scratch, but now it seems to flow a bit better. I find myself logically thinking out data presentation much quicker. Instead of stumbling with looping through block children and figuring out for loops, it just makes more sense. I don't know if it's from my React practice or just getting better at Craft, but things just make more sense.</p>

<h3>What I remembered this week</h3>
<p>Something I don't use often but always recall how awesome it is - the <code>counter-increment</code> unit in CSS. Basically you can make any set of elements like an ordered list. With the <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> structure you don't really have options for styling the numbers, however if you use a <code>counter-increment</code> on a <code>:before</code> for a set of divs you can get really creative. It also allows nesting lists, as well as using roman numerals, and sub items like a, b, c, etc..</p>
<p>I had to create a simple Sign Up explanation module on my client project, but it had to be styled in a certain way, and the last element had to be a check-mark. Sure I could use images, but that's a pain and not flexible. I could hard code the numbers, but I'm cynical and know as soon as I do that they'll want to change it. So let's write it correctly the first time, that way its completely dynamic. On the parent wrapper I set my <code>counter-reset: mycounter</code>, and then on each child div I set a <code>:before</code> with <code>counter-increment: mycounter;</code> and <code>content: counter(mycounter);</code>. I simply override the last child's content with a check and we're all set. Doesn't matter if the list is 2, 3, or 100 items long.</p>

<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>I took my WAZA time early this week after being roadblocked on a project I stepped away to work on my React-tac-toe application for a while. I am still figuring things out, but I am getting more comfortable in React. My app now prevents you from clicking squares that already have been chosen, and now also have a 'clicked' class with a flag for which player selected it to add some visual flair.</p>

<p>I still need to figure out how to stop the game when someone wins, get a restart function working, and clean up the code. Then I will dive into more complex applications.</p>
