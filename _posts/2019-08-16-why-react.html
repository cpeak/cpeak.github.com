<p>Last year I set a goal to get to the Technical Expert level of our Design Crafter career path, and we determined that learning React would be the most valuable way to get to that level.</p>
<h3>What is React</h3>
<p><i>Simply</i> put, React is a Javascript library for building user interfaces. Okay, thats not simple. What React lets you do is build an application piece by piece using <strong>components</strong>.</p>
<p>Components are a lot like templates in Jekyll or Middleman where you feed it information, and it spits it out in the form you want. What makes it really powerful is the Javascript behind it. React allows you to do many things that just aren't possible in a statically generated site.</p>
<h3>Why Learn React</h3>
<p>We have a lot of projects written in React in some form or another, so knowing it gives me a lot of flexibility to be staffed in different places. Win for 8th Light.</p>
<p>What's really cool is you're building an app by creating custom HTML elements, kind of like making your own Legos. For example, in my Portal application, one feature is a list of crafters and their apprentices. On the page that lists all the Employees, I simply call <code>&lt;Employees /&gt;</code>. The Employees component renders a list of <code>&lt;Employee /&gt;</code> components, which has its own list of <code>&lt;Apprentice /&gt;</code> components. It's a lot more complex than that, but thats a high level overview.</p>
<p>React is very powerful: it replaces the browser DOM with a virtual DOM stored in memory, so the application can update single components or elements without reloading the entire page. I can handle the state of the app, and write regular Javascript functions to perform whatever actions are needed.</p>
<h3>What I've learned</h3>
<p>I don't like learning from videos or blog posts. What I like is building my own applications using the concepts from other tutorials. I have a few projects that I have been working on as practical examples of using React.</p>
<p><strong>React-Tac-Toe</strong>. This was my first intro into React. It took a while and I really struggled with the basic idea of components, state, and properties. Eventually I got it working well enough to play a game, although it doesn't stop when someone wins. I should really go back and improve it knowing what I do now.</p>

<p><strong>Portal</strong> This is an app I've been working on in one form or another for a few years. Originally built in Middleman, porting it to React was a great exercise in taking data from a "database" (just a JSON file), and mapping it into an array of objects. I also built in a guessing game that randomly pulls a photo and 6 names for the user to try to guess who it actually is.</p>

<p><strong>Lineage</strong> This app I literally threw together in a few days to continue my knowledge of State, properties, and passing data between components. A genealogy app really keeps me interested in learning how to more things, and in using the app I keep finding more and more features I want to build.</p>

<p><strong>Business Card App</strong> While Lineage was a personal, off-hours project, a business card generator would provide some actual value to 8th Light. This only took an afternoon to throw together. The user simply enters their information, toggles between options, and then submits the card to make a request. That was the easy part, now I have to figure out how to make it generate a PDF that the printer can use. Thats going to be a tough one.</p>

<h3>Long way to go</h3>
<p>Im now staffed on Harvest which is a very complex React/Gatsby/CosmicJS application, and while I have a lot to learn, just working on these little simple apps already gave me a huge leg up in understanding the codebase. I opened up some of the views I needed to style and immediately knew, generally speaking, how everything was wired up. There's some really complex things in there that I have yet to wrap my head around, but if I didn't have the experience beforehand I would definitely be struggling.</p>
<p>Still a long way to go and lots to learn, but I'll continue to blog about how the journey is going here so I can share my experiences with the Design Team.</p>
