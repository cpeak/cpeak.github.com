<p>Check out the article over at <a href='http://gizmodo.com/watch-new-york-city-s-boundaries-expand-over-250-years-496440467'>Gizmodo</a>. Interesting to see how much it expands over the years, but even more facinating is the fact that the majority of modern Boston is built on landfill. You can see colonial Boston overlaid on the current map.</p>
