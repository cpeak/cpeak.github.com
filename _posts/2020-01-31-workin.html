<h2>What I worked on:</h2>
<p>Another week of working on internal projects and helping out a few teams where I can. Some big updates on the house hunt, but not ready to make any announcements quite yet. This whole process is daunting, but I'm very happy I have a team around me that I trust to guide us through it.</p>
<h2>What I learned:</h2>
<p>This week I spun up a development Gatsby (+ Typescript) server to work on our internal project. It was fairly straight forwards and I didn't have any issues getting it going within minutes. Looking forward to seeing how this new environment is going to suit our needs.</p>
<h2>Positive notes:</h2>
<p>Missed two days of guitar practice, but I've gotta stick with it and keep going. I knew it wasn't going to be every single day, but I don't want to give up after a strong January.</p>
