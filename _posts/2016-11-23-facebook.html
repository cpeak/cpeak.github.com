<p>I joined Facebook sometime in 2006 and while it was fun for while, today I find almost no reason to open it up and peruse my feed other than it's habit at this point. My 'news' feed has become clogged with completely useless junk that I don't want to see. Over time I started to realize that my feed was nothing but strangers, advertisements, and junk news. Every time I opened the app and scanned for a minute I would ask myself 'Why am I doing this? Where is the value in this mess'.</p>

<p>I'm not in high school anymore so I don't know the friends of my friends, and call me an old crumudgeon but I don't have an interest in their posts. If I did, I would friend them. The whole point of Facebook was to connect with the people I <strong>choose</strong> to. My news feed has been compromised and I can't turn it off. I am being served with a firehose when I just wanted a glass of water.</p>

<p>A few months ago I wondered if I could somehow track the number of valuable posts vs the garbage. I wondered if my friends posts were worth sifting through the seemingly endless stream of detrius, so I opened a spreadsheet and catagorized the first 99 posts in my feed. I sat on it for a while just thinking about it and nothing came from it.</p>

<p>I wanted at least one more data set, so I went through the same exercise a couple of days ago and started putting more thought into it. I thought about how to categorize posts in order to assess value to them, breaking them out into these sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ads</li>
  <li>Like/comment/tag in Friend of Friend (i.e. Strangers) post</li>
  <li>Shared junk article</li>
  <li>Actual valuable post</li>
</ul>

<p>Facebook is fundamentally broken right now - my feed is X% strangers, X% ads, and only X% posts that I actually want to see. Combine this with privacy and tracking concerns. The problem is the value it originally provided isn't replicated anywhere else. I can't just switch to a different service and keep up with friends and family. All of this could be solved by one simple preference: "Show me likes/comments/shares of friends only". Why doesn't this exist?</p>
