<h2>Getting back in the habit</h2>
<p>Since 2019 I was in the habit of writing weekly updates as a creative exercise, and I kept the streak going for quite a while. Unfortunately after a vacation last summer I took a break and never got back into it. So now I'd like to get back on the horse and keep generating more content. I'm not sure what it's going to look like right now, but I know it will probably be different than the weekly posts. The rough plan is to write about some things that interest me, like web design, cycling, and vintage computers, but I am going to take January to figure things out.</p>
<h2>My "new" toy</h2>
<p>After a Slack discussion with friends in early December, my friend Brian mentioned he had an Apple IIe sitting in storage that could use a new home, and I was happy to take him up on the offer. I picked it up, brought it home, and set it up on my workbench. Apple II's are known for being extremely reliable computers and I was delighted to find that this particular machine was in great shape.</p>

<p>I fired it up and everything booted normally, however I was getting some errors when trying to read some disks. I initially thought maybe the disk drives were faulty, I eventually ran the system diagnostic boot sequence and discovered one of the RAM chips wasn't working correctly. Some more research online confirmed that this was one of the few common points of failure, so I'm going to have to perform a repair soon. Unfortunately the RAM chips are soldered onto the motherboard, so I'm going to have to dust off my iron and get some practice under my belt while a replacement is on its way from China. I'll definitely post more about my Apple II adventures, so stay tuned.</p>
<p>Happy New Year everyone, and I hope 2022 is better than the past few!</p>
