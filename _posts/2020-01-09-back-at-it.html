<h2>What I worked on</h2>
<p>This time of year is pretty quiet, so client work is sparse at the moment. I've been working on internal projects and learning a lot, specifically taking another look at implementing Google OAuth in my React project. Not a lot of headway, but Im just getting started.</p>
<h2>What I learned</h2>
<p>My head is still spinning from the OAuth work, but one thing I did learn was a fun bash alias trick for chaining commands. I previously wrote a post about <a href="/2019/08/26/terminal-tips">terminal tips</a>, part of which touched on bash shortcuts. I had a number of them set to jump to certain directories, which was handy, but I wondered if I could jump to a directory and run a command.Â I jumped into Slack and asked if I could do something like <code>alias foo = 'cd ~/Sites/project && jekyll serve'</code>, which would jump to the project directory and spin up the Jekyll server all in one command. Apparently I was 100% correct, and that alias worked perfectly. It seems I can use <code>&&</code> or <code>;</code> to separate the commands, where the <code>&&</code> means run the first command, and only run the second if the first succeeds. Using <code>;</code> means run both no matter what.</p>
