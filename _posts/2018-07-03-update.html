<p>Alright, time to get back on the horse. I wrote my last post 358 days ago, so before I hit that full-year mark its time to get going again.</p>
<!--break-->
<p>I want to get back into the flow of writing, the intial goal is to write once a week going over what I have learned or what challenges I faced over the past week. It was something I enjoyed doing during my apprenticeship, but now 6 years later I have maybe a dozen posts since.</p>
<p>There are a number of reasons I want to get back into it.</p>
<p>First I just need to improve my writing skills. I always joke that I write like a caveman, but its time to put that one to rest.</p>
<p>Second, I finally re-designed my blog again (for the umpteenth time). It used to be very stark, black and white, minimalist which most of the time I like however I wanted something new and fresh, so I did something I don't usually do: use a ton of colors. I don't want to waste the redesign even though I am probably going to change it again in another six months.</p>
<p>Third, I got a new Macbook Pro and set everything up from scratch. A fresh start on a new machine. Surprisingly I had it up and running within an hour or so. That was from opening the box to in a complete development-ready setup. The only snag was getting my PATH setup correctly with RVM, and the longest thing was setting up my VIM color palette. Ill write another post about moving to the new Macbook after a few days with it. So far the lack of escape key isn't as difficult as I would have thought, but its still weird until I get the muscle memory down. Anyway, more on that later.</p>
