<h2>What I worked on:</h2>
<p>Continued working on our React + Storybook project and really feeling comfortable with styled components. I love the structure and how clean my code seems to be staying. No issues so far. The stay-at-home order for Covid is going alright, thank god we're in the new house instead of our old place. I really count myself lucky with the fact we have such a large plot of land out back that we can explore now that spring is finally here.</p>
<p>I also ran over to Menard's and got some supplies to officially kick off the basement remodel. Going to start hanging drywall on the ceiling soon, although drilling inside is a bit too loud, it startles the 10 month old, so I can only do it when she's outside with Momma, that may slow things down considerably.</p>

<h2>What I learned:</h2>
<p>I can't think of anything specific to be honest. These days are blurring together. I had a challenge with some client work of taking a page with a new set of stylesheets for a future update and shoe-horning it into the old design while managing a set of conflicts that arose from things being overridden.</p>
<h2>Positive notes:</h2>
<p>We're trying to stay positive and are hunkered down. We have enough food and supplies so we're okay. Finally got to use the firepit for the first time, although I need to clean it out so I can have a nice sustainable fire.</p>
