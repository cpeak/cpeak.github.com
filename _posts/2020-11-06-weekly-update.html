<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Getting back on track with work and delivering features at a pace I'm more comfortable with, so things are looking up. My LEGO Saturn V arrived and I stole a few hours the other night, assembling the third stage and I am completely blown away by the build quality and just sheer size of the kit. Looking forward to completing it soon.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Just more headaches with getting pulled in different directions in terms of what to work on. I was able to pivot quickly given the circumstances, but there's still a story from a sprint or two ago that they keep punting on and since it has my name on it I'm a little frustrated. Hopefully I'll be able to pick it back up soon.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>While waiting for a few packages to I stumbled across a video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3qfeoqErtY" target="blank">how overnight shipping works</a>, which I found absolutely fascinating. I heard a talk at a conference years ago from one of the heads of logistics for UPS and on the surface that sounds boring but so much is involved it makes your head spin.</p>
