<p>Given now that if you saw me in half you will see over 30 rings (thats how it works right?) I have started to push myself to get into better shape. This involves me eating better, doing more yoga, and despite my best efforts to this point in my life, running. My wife and I have done two 5k's at this point but have only walked/jogged them due to her back problems. When we signed up for the second I made it a goal that I would be able to run the whole thing without dying of a heart attack half-way through. Even though we would walk/jog it together, I wanted to know I could run it if I wanted to. Well, the second 5k came and went and I didn't exactly hit my goal, I had started running but didn't really know how far I was running, only a vague idea of how long I was running for.</p>
<p>Luckily I started a project at work with a new client, and without going into details I get to use a Nike FuelBand as an exploration of internet connected devices. I have had it for just over a day and so far I am really loving it. Its extremely comfortable and dirt simple to use. The model I am using is the <a href="http://store.nike.com/us/en_us/pd/fuelband/pid-691776/pgid-670534">Black Ice</a> version which looks pretty slick.</p>

<p>Setup was a breeze, Nike has put a lot of thought into making it simple to get it customized for you and getting you out and being active instead of poking around on a computer. Pairing to my iPhone was also dirt simple, and syncing progress is easy as holding down the one button on the FuelBand for a second or two.</p>
<p>I will use it in conjunction with the Nike+ Running app to track my runs and see how active I am over time. I was impressed with the Nike+ website interface.  Goal tracking and achievements are actually fun, and the data collected is comprehensive as well as presented very well.</p>

<p>I'll share some of my thoughts and experiences over the course of the next few months as use the FuelBand and App to track my progress.</p>
