<p>Yesterday the 8th Light design team assembled at our newest office located in Madison Wisconsin. Recently we acquired a company called <a href="www.adorable.io" target="blank">Adorable</a> based out of Madison. To welcome our new members on the Design team I drove our Chicago designers up to Wisconsin for a day trip so we could all hang out and get to know each other better.</p>

<p>I completely forgot that Adorable is a dog friendly office, so of course Riesling got all the love before anyone said hello to anyone else.</p>

  <p>We had a great team lunch at The Great Dane and talked for quite a while, discussing what we are all passionate about, what got us into tech, and where we would like the design team to be in the future. We spent the rest of the afternoonn working from their office space and then headed back to Chicago. Totally worth the trip.</p>
<h3>What I learned this week</h3>
<p>I'm most happy about just spending the drive to and from Madison getting to know my teammates better. We talked the whole way both ways and discovered some fun things about each other, it was a great bonding experience.</p>
<p>On the tech side I am starting to help out on a project written in Elixer, Erlang, and Node which the first two are new to me. We'll see how it goes. I was able to get the proejct up on and running very easily apart from some Postgres setup issues, but those were resolved in a few minutes.</p>
<p>One thing I saw but haven't had the time to dive into is the <code>fr</code> CSS attribute which I hadn't heard of before. From my initial scan of the article you can tell an element to span the rest of the available space in that row which might sound mundane at first glance, could be extremely powerful. I'm hoping to read up on it later this afternoon if it's not too crazy.</p>
