<p>Who says you have to start new routines and improvements at New Years? This past week the wife and I have been tearing through our house using the Marie Kondo method and getting some serious results. No, really, try it. Its overwhelming at first, but if you start small you'll start gaining steam. Anyway, part of this "spring cleaning" as it is I wanted to try a few more things to improve my daily routine to hopefully boost my productivity and overall well being.</p>
<p>So here we are, Day 1. It's 5:40 in the morning and I've already had a light breakfast and done a surprisingly good yoga session. Yes, my legs were shaking and my muscles were complaining but I knew how good it would feel and I was right. Now I'm banging out this post before I get ready for work.</p>
<p>I really wish I knew where I saw it, but someone tweeted something along the lines of "If you read a good sci-fi book, would that stop you from reading a different one, or writing one yourself?" The gist of it was just because someone else is writing tons of good content that you may write about you shouldn't just throw in the towel and not do it yourself. That's been my big hang-up for a while now: Why would I write a blog post about X when there are 1000 other people writing about the same thing. I'm going to try to change that. I want to start blogging more, mainly for myself, and if someone else finds something interesting, that's great. If not, who cares.</p>
<p>The other thing to push me to write more is a quote I found by Jodi Picoult:</p>
<blockquote>You can always edit a bad page. You can't edit a blank page.</blockquote>
<p>How awesome is that? So here we go. A new routine where hopefully I'll be a bit more productive, write a lot more, and hopefully not grunt while putting on my socks. Alright, off to work.</p>
<p><strong>Note to self:</strong> Handel is beautiful, but a bit too morose for a yoga playlist.</p>
