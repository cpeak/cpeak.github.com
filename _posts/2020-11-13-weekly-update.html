<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Got the bike in good shape although winter is coming. RAGBRAI registration opens in December but I think im going to wait until '22. I just can't justify leaving for a week when we're (hopefully) just coming out of a pandemic. Also taking a solo vacation when we didn't do a family one last year is a tad selfish.</p>
<p>I also was able to fully assemble my official LEGO Saturn V kit and I am just astonished at the build, it was utterly insane. I'll write a full post on that soon.</p>
<p>Flooring for the basement is purchased and ready for install, so I'll be tackling that next week.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Another difficult week on my client project, this is the point where management starts circling in and disrupting hoping to speed things up. We're shifting from 2 week sprints to kanban continuous work, and the client devs are all working on the weekends. We politely declined that one.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>Speaking of the Saturn V, I love the story about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSSmNUl9Snw" target="blank">the greatest software hack ever</a>, that saved the Apollo 14 mission.</p>
