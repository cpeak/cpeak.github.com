<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Huge win this week on a side project for work. An app I've been playing around with for years got the green light to get some developer help and published internally, so work finally got &quot;started&quot;. A pair of developers dove into my rickety Typescript code and got a lot of things fixed very quickly, and thankfully reported that the foundation is solid. They tore through some feature requests and got a lot of things in order that I just wasn't able to do, so next week we're looking at setting up the deployment pipeline and do a limited internal release before opening it up to everyone.</p>
<p>The other big win was last weekend I added a hinge and castors to the bookcase entrance to the home theater. My concept worked perfectly and it swings open extremely smoothly. I still need to drill shelf pin holes, cut the shelves, add the top piece, and then trim everything, but just seeing it in action was great.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Not really a challenge, and I'm not complaining, but seeing a codebase I've been working on for years suddenly be open to other developers is a strange feeling. I know they're going to improve it and get it ready for release, but it's been my baby for so long its just ... weird.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>Next week is more work on the internal app, more prototyping for my client in preparation for round two of user testing, and then hopefully some more time working on the bookcase. Just around the corner is my first vacation in over a year, so I'm already daydreaming about hanging out in Connecticut. Lots to take care of first.</p>
