<p>After a nice break, I'm back at my desk to start the new year. For the past few years I have piled up my PTO and burned most of it in December, which I enjoy. It gives me a good amount of time to decompress and spend time with my family not thinking about getting back to work. Luckily I have a job that allows me this kind of flexibility, so I always keep that in mind and am very thankful.</p>
<h3>2019</h3>
<p>So far so good on the redesign of the site. Since bulldozing it in August I am still really happy with the design - that may be a record. I'm not sure if I am going to add many features this year, probably just tweaks here and there while focusing on writing. My goal was to write posts journaling what I had learned week to week, and I kept up with it (minus my time off), so I plan on sticking to it and keep it going.</p>
<h3>2020</h3>
<p>Looking ahead I really want to keep up writing, so my goal is to have 40 or 50 posts this year. For non-work related goals I plan on taking better care of myself, getting back into yoga, eating better, and being more positive. I also want to pick up the guitar again and stick with it. Hopefully I'll be able to practice at least a few minutes per day, which should produce some steady improvement.</p>
<h3>The Great Catalina Update</h3>
<p>I made the leap and updated to Catalina, saying goodbye to 32bit. The biggest loss is SimCity 4 and Counter Strike which honestly will only make me more productive, although it was nice to take a break from work sometimes to play a quick round on Dust2. I don't see too many issues so far, nothing crashed, nor were there any issues with the update itself, but we'll see how it plays out...</p>
<p>The only other app that's been <i>sunsetted</i> is TextWrangler which I have been using for a long time. It's been rolled into BBEdit which I haven't used since, im guessing, the Mac OS 8 days. I love the fact that Bare Bones have been actively developing Mac apps since the early 90s.</p>
