<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>A few months ago a book slid down and knocked my FFVII Aerith statuette off of the floating shelf in my office. Unfortunately she was damaged pretty significantly losing both arms, a leg, and her hair. I debating straight up replacing it, but I realized I had bought it back in the early 00s and the only ones I could find on eBay were well north of $250 dollars. So it was time to get out the super glue. While I got her limbs back on, there just wasn't enough surface area to glue her pony tail back on. After some research and discussion with friends, I learned that I could use a tiny drill called a pin vice, to open up a small hole and use a piece of a paperclip to hold everything together.</p>

<p>I very gently drilled a hole with the pin vice and inserted a small piece of paperclip. I drilled another hole in the back of her ponytail, then added superglue and used a twist-tie to hold it in place for 24 hours (just to be sure). Came out probably stronger than before, so thats a win.</p>

<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>I had my second COVID vaccine dose on Thursday at 2pm, and sure enough the next morning I developed a headache, then a good fever and chills. I spent the rest of the day in bed, finally waking up around 7 when my fever broke and after a good dinner I felt right as rain. Two weeks for everything to kick in and I'm completely vaccinated. Still going to use a mask for a while despite what the CDC says...</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>If you're interested in model building or repairs then check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qu-ZkM5kk3g" target="blank">this YouTube video on how to use a Pin Vice</a>. Great information.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>As I mentioned last week I was looking at a few different action cameras and I finally ordered an <a href="https://www.insta360.com">Insta360 ONE X2</a> to record my bike rides and have fun with the kids. I'll share my experience with the camera here over the coming weeks. Should be a lot of fun!</p>
