<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>Just getting back into the flow of things, and after last week, finding some momentum in picking up my React project and blowing the dust off. I made the leap and started re-writing it in React + Typescript which was a challenge (more on that below). I think the big push was from a few co-workers after I gave a quick demo in a meeting. They were really excited about it which in turn kind of made me want to bring some more time and attention to it.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>The big problem was Typescript. I ran into an issue trying to map an object and an array contained within, which had me scratching my head and chasing my tail for at least a few hours. I got pulled off to another project unfortunately, but Ill circle back to it next week with a clear mind and hopefully make some progress.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I was going to post something about Typescript from the fight with my project earlier but I'm feeling frustrated, so I'd rather share a random nugget of knowledge that recently surfaced again. There was no name for the spikes on a Stegosaurus tail until The Far Side comic strip creator Gary Larson made a strip in which a caveman teaches his friends about &quot;...the Thagomizer, after the late Thag Simmons&quot;. After which the scientific community now <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thagomizer" target="blank">uses the term</a>. I love it.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>A new section! This probably won't be every week, but we'll see. Looking ahead! There's a good foot of snow on the ground right now and I'm dying to get out on my bike which won't happen for a while. Until then I'm going to start setting some goals and planning some things for later this year. Ideally I'd like to do a weekend/multi-day trip somewhere and work up to RAGBRAI next year. I'm also looking forward to just getting outside and not freezing, which the current forecast isn't helping.</p>
