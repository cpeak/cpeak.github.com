<p>The wonderful thing about having a toddler at home is being able to introduce her to the works of Hayao Miyazaki, which also means some great opportunities for Halloween costumes. This year my daughter watched Sprited Away for the first time and absolutely loved it. After repeated viewings and some <a href="#" target="blank">inspiration from Adam Savage</a> I decided to create a No Face costume for trick-or-treating. For those who don't know <i>Sprited Away</i>, I implore you, go see it now. Anyway, on to the build...</p>

<p>I don't have a lot of experience in costume making or cosplay, but a few years ago I started making a fiberglass resin Boba Fett helmet. I started by putting together a paper Pepakura model then coating it in resin and fiberglass, making it extremely hard. I never got past the initial sculpt, but I had the technique down.</p>

<p>The reason I never got too far with it was that it was <i>really</i> hard, making it extremely difficult to sand and fill gaps. Knowing this I thought that a simple paper mache mask with some modeling clay might be easier and quicker to do.</p>
<p>I found a good plan online and put it all together pretty quickly. Paper models aren't too difficult, just a little time consuming. The first problem came when I tried to apply the paper mache strips. Without any backing the paper didn't hold up to the newspaper strips and the whole thing collapsed into itself. Some ribbing or temporary support underneath would be needed. I printed and assembled another base, along with some cardboard ribbing. Same issue, the paper got too messy and soaked, eventually just collapsing again.</p>
