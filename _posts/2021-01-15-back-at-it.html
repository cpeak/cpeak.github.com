<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>With all the chaos going on surrounding the election and inauguration next week, I think the fact that I was able to get some work done this week was a win on its own. It's our last week on the client project and despite the challenges we hit our launch goal. I was skeptical around Thanksgiving since the client's engineers were working weekends and a most evenings, and things were not in the best shape, but all that hard work paid off and we launched.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>Since launch the focus of the team has been testing and bug fixing, so I was shifted into more of a standby and help out position, meaning there wasn't a lot on my plate at the time. It was difficult feeling like I was providing value to the team and being productive while not taking on something I couldn't wrap up by the end of the week.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I haven't been able to take a deep dive into it yet, but it looks like <code>aspect-ratio</code> is finally coming to CSS! No more padding-top hacks and work arounds to maintain div sizes. I'm really looking forward to taking time to read through <a href="https://css-tricks.com/a-first-look-at-aspect-ratio/" target="blank">CSS Tricks first look at 'aspect-ratio'</a> article and then frantically looking back over past projects to see where I need to update my code.</p>
