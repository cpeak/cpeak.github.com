<p>Most of the time you can call me an early adopter. I bought an iPod the first day they were available back in 2001. I'm not gun-shy of upgrading OS X on release days (heck, I *paid* to get my hands on 10.0 beta). So when Mavericks dropped a week or two ago I fired up the App store and dove right in. A lot of people I know wait until at least the first patch, but I &lt;knocking on keyboard&gt; have never had any problems before. The install went just fine, I was a little annoyed at the 'less than a minute', then restart and more waiting, but aside from that I was playing around with 10.9 within an hour. Awesome.</p>
<p>The only problem I have seem to have encountered popped up yesterday while I was at <a href="http://scna.softwarecraftsmanship.org">SCNA 2013</a>. I wrote a simple 1 page script that pulls Instagram photos based on a provided tag, and overlays them on a Mapbox map of where they were taken. I wanted to see who was taking photos and using the #scna hashtag so I opened chrome and went to <code>localhost/instagram</code> (not a very clever name I admit). Not found. Hmm. Apache running? Check. Hmm. I suddenly had flashbacks to years ago when I would spend hours chasing my tail trying to get virtual hosts configured properly. My palms started to sweat.</p>
<p>Then I remembered my <code>DocumentRoot</code> setting in <code>/etc/apache2/httpd.conf</code> file by default is not the old Sites directory. Fire up vim, and aha! OS X had defaulted it back to <code>/Library/WebServer/Documents</code>. I commented out that line to remember what the 'default' now is, and simply added <code>DocumentRoot &quot;/Users/cpeak/Sites&quot;</code>. Now any static HTML projects in my site directory get served up using <code>localhost/...</code> in the browser.</p>
<p>Just in case you were curious, here's that Instagram puller...</p>
