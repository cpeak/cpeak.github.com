<p>I'm trying to wrap my head around how to build the cat's head, and I have decided my first step is going to build a quick one small-scale. There is a vibrant online scene that originated in Japan called 'Pepakura', which I believe means 'papercraft'. You can download 3D models of just about anything you can imagine, print them out, and with some time and patience cut and glue them together to create a full 3D model. I used this technique as the basis for my Daft Punk and Boba Fett helmets - the next step being covering them in resin and a hard fiberglass shell inside to make them sturdy).</p>
<p>I found this basic Catbus online and printed it out, I don't think it will take more than an hour to create the head (im not interested in the rest for now).</p>

<p>Once I can see the dimensions and how it looks and feels, I may scale up and build a fullsize version to mount on the wagon, or I may simplify it with fewer facets. We'll see how it goes.</p>
