<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>I've been looking into getting a GoPro or Insta360 camera for recording bike rides, but the big problem is that since I ride a recumbent I didn't have an easy way to mount a camera anywhere. I really didn't want to get a helmet mount since I look around so much while I ride, so the recording would probably look pretty bad. Thankfully I found a Linear rider in Canada who posts his rides on YouTube, and in one of his videos he mentioned that he designed a 3D printable mount for an action camera. Intrigued I reached out to see if I could get the plans, and thankfully he was super nice and emailed them to me right away. I took them to my local library, and a few days later I had a custom mount for the bike. I stopped at the hardware store to pick up some M6 bolts and mounted it to the main beam just behind the front wheel.</p>

<p>Next up is to invest in a nice camera, I'll share more about which ones I'm looking at and which one I chose whenever I pull the trigger.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>My work project has been going very smoothly, so no problems there. The biggest challenge this week was my wife had her second COVID vaccine dose, so she was knocked out all day Thursday, but today she's right as rain.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I don't have a 3D printer, and before last week I had zero experience with 3D designs, but the local library did a quick tutorial video <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="blank">on using AutoDesk's Tinkercad</a> editing program that runs right in any browser. Its a lot of fun, and I was able to import the .stl files for the camera mount.</p>
<p>You can create a free account and play around, it's a lot of fun and fairly intuitive.</p>
<h2>Looking ahead</h2>
<p>I'll be looking at a number of action cams this week and hopefully placing an order in the next few days, when I do I'll share my thoughts and experience.</p>
