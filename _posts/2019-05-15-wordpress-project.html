<p>This past week I wrapped up Phase I and launch of a client project which was a definite learning experience for me. My client is a non-profit with no IT or Software Development staff at all, so when we set out to rebuild their website it needed to be powerful and flexible, but maintainable and updatable from the browser itself with limited updates on the back end. Woof, thats a bit of a challenge. I've spent the last seven years custom writing software in call kinds of languages and frameworks but have only played around with Worddpress for about a week.</p>
<p>The biggest reason we went with Wordpress is actually a plugin called <a href="https://elementor.com/" target="blank">Elementor</a>. It's a tool that lets users control the content and layout for a Wordpress project all through a really interesting GUI. I was apprehensive at first, knowing there would be limitations to it, but over the course of the buildout I only had a few technical issues to overcome.</p>
<p>After Elementor, the use of <a href="https://pods.io/" target="blank">PODs</a> was another lifesaver. This framework extended Wordpress to allow me to create custom blocks, such as job postings, action alerts, newsletters, and downloadable resources. I could setup custom templates in html and output the items using very powerful shortcodes.</p>
<p>One of the problems I'm still working on is the navigation. I need the users to be able to use the WP-Admin GUI to rearrange the nav items, but the original design proposal was fairly complex with custom blocks in dropdowns. After creating a child-theme from the basic Twenty Nineteen theme, the php that controls how the menu is rendered is thoroughly confusing. I couldn't figure out how to blow away all the crust from the other plugin and just spit out a list of links. My navigation code looks like this:</p>

<p>One of the biggest technical challenges was how to get data from the forms on the site into Salesforce. That by itself wasn't very hard, but for most situations the client's workflow skips the Lead step and automatically creates a Contact object. After a few dead ends we finally settled on using <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="blank">Zapier</a>. This service hooks directly into Salesforce. When a new Lead is created (by pushing data from the site into Salesforce) it will, depending on a few filters, automatically pass it along into a Contact Object. It took me a while to wrap my head around setting up the forms and passing along all the data so it winds up in the correct spots.</p>
<p>Overall I am happy with the project and will keep working on the site in more of a support role. Wordpress + Elementor is a great solution for those without dedicated development staff, but it does come with limitations.</p>
