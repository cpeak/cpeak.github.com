<h2>This week's win(s)</h2>
<p>I typically take a good chunk of time off around Christmas &amp; New Years, and that was the plan for 2020 as well, so I was surprised when I logged into our time tracking app and realized I had not one, but two full weeks of PTO to burn. I had only planned on one, so getting an extra week off is a nice end of year surprise, but I'm not sure how I will spread it out. We have a tight deadline of the 17th for my client project, so we'll see how everything plays out.</p>
<h2>This week's challenges</h2>
<p>This week has been okay, there were some small challenges with delivering a few stories, but nothing major. After our hard push right before Thanksgiving things have calmed down quite a bit. It's nice not to be rushing as we approach the launch date - we're down to small fixes here and there.</p>
<h2>Learn with me</h2>
<p>I haven't looked closely at it yet, but I'll share this tweet here so I can circle back to it - Andy Bell shared a tip for <a href="https://twitter.com/piccalilli_/status/1336637570059526147?s=21" target="blank">spacing around targeted elements</a> which in the past has been pretty tricky. Something worth looking into.</p>
