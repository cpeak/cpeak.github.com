<p>This Friday is the last day of my residency with 8th Light and I wanted to share some of what I learned about how designers and developers work together to create premier software, some of the pitfalls you can stumble into, and how you can improve your development environment. Curating a successful company culture is vital to making it, so here are some of my thoughts...</p>


<h3>Solve the same problem</h3>
<p>At <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/stephanie-briones">Stephanie Briones'</a> <a href="http://university.8thlight.com">8th Light University</a> talk a few months ago she presented the audience with a very interesting problem - we were tasked with laying out ideas for an app that tracks and manages your online subscriptions. We were to break into small groups and sketch out interface designs and how the app should work, then present them to everyone. The most fascinating thing to me was watching how different people approached the problem. Some of the programmers were talking about various code solutions - real nitty gritty details, one was even lobbying for a command-line interface. A few designers in the crowd were sketching out ideas for UI, layouts, interface details, or a giant picture of Bill Cosby. At the end of the exercise the groups who presented the most coherent solutions seemed to look at the bigger picture and asked a lot of questions about the overall functionality - how would they want it to work? They brainstormed on how to solve the <i>users</i> problem. They didn't get caught up on the implementation details, they understood that those came later.</p>


<h3>Go from sharpie to pen to code</h3>
<p><em>Details don't matter up front</em>. The most important step is sitting down as a team and figuring how the application will flow. Ask how users are going to arrive on and move away from key screens. While figuring all this out be sure to use lots of paper and big sharpie (or heck, why not crayons?) to lay out the screens with little to no words. <em>Be quick</em> - don't get hung up on the little things like code or UI details - these can be addressed at the appropriate time. Right now your attention better spent getting everyone on the same page while laying a solid foundation. Using rough sketches allows you to explore different solutions quickly and see which stand out. Your'e going to make mistakes and find the bad designs, but at this stage you can recover from those very quickly - just grab a new piece of paper. Once everyone has explored the better ideas and gotten a good grasp on how the app will function &amp; flow then it's time to get out the pen.</p>

<p>Now its time to figure out what the business logic and overall domain language of the app will be. Decisions here can have ramifications later down the road, that's why it is vital to have both design and development input at this point in the process. How are your models going to be setup? Are your users People? Clients? Employees? This is a critical junction that requires everyone's input, decisions made now will be difficult to change later. Once you finalize your language, the developers can start stubbing out code and designers can start working on templates.</p>


<h3>Work from the inside out</h3>
<p>Lets pretend you're a designer - if you <em>are</em> a designer, pretend you're wearing a cape. When working on the initial layout templates, just like the first round of sketches, don't get caught up in the tiny UI details right off the bat. Focus on the key screens and what information is most important to the user. Once you stub out the basic HTML it gives the programmers something to sink their teeth into! They can look at the view template and have a much clearer idea of how the model and controllers are going to function, than if they were staring at a Photoshop mockup.</p>


<p>Once you have the essential HTML up and the programmers are happily working on the back end, you can start drilling down a little more, step by step. Don't pick out curtains when the walls are still going up - ignore typeface selection, navigation, banners, color schemes, etc. When the app starts functioning you'll get a much better feel for the finer points and those decisions will be much easier. As the app grows you will see how laying a solid foundation has helped avoid major problems down the line.</p>

<h3>Many Thanks</h3>
<p>The past three months have been a blast, and I hope to continue on my journey with 8th Light for as long as possible.  Many thanks to <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/micah-martin">Micah</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.8thlight.com/our-team/stephanie-briones">Stephanie</a> for being great mentors, Billy for bringing me to 8th Light and helping me start my residency, as well as the entire 8th Light team for being absolutely incredible.</p>
