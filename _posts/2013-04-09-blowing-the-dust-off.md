title: Blowing The Dust Off
---

<p>This blog was originally written and maintained during my apprenticeship at 8th Light, but quickly fell out of use when I became a Craftsman. I'm blowing the dust off, gutting the code, updating the design, and with a bit of effort hopefully start using it a bit more.  I plan on posting more personal blog entries here, as well as code &amp; design ideas, random photos, and generally whatever catches my attention for more than a few seconds. Stay tuned.</p>
