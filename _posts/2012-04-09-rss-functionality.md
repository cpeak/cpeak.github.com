<h2>New: RSS/Atom Feed Support</h2>
<p>Today I added RSS and Atom feed support for my residency blog. Thanks to GitHub user <a href="https://github.com/coyled/coyled.com">Dave Coyle</a> for the Jekyll Atom &amp; RSS templates, as well as a tip of the hat to <a href="https://github.com/beporter">beporter</a> for the link. </p>
