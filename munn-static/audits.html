  <h2 class="title centered">Audit Bulletin #2</h2>
  <div class="panel">
    <p><i>Waivers of Lien, are they proof of Payment? Why you should worry:</i></p>
    <p>In our 35 years of construction auditing a Waiver of Lien has never been the absolute proof of Payment from a GC/CM to a Subcontractor or Supplier.</p>
    <p>If a GC/CM bills for a Subcontractor or Supplier and the GC/CM does not pay the amount billed, who is entitled to these funds the <strong>GC/CM</strong>, <strong>the Owner</strong>, or <strong>the Lender</strong>?</p>
    <p>One key fact to remember is when the Owner's Application for Payment to the LendingInstitution contains the Application for Payment from the GC/CM (including Waivers of Lien) and it is Approved by the Owner, Architect and the Lending Institution Owner's Representativeeveryone is certifying that Subcontractors have been paid their previous amount's bill.</p>
    <p>Here is <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/chicago/press-releases/2013/two-former-krahl-construction-executives-sentenced-to-prison-terms-for-billing-fraud-and-kickback-scheme" target="_blank">what happened when Waivers of Lien were incorrect</a>.</p>

  <h2 class="title centered">Audit Bulletin #3</h2>
  <div class="panel">
    <p><i>Is it possible that a Construction Contract conflict could lead to an over charge to an Owner or Lender for Insurance?</i></p>
    <p><strong>Yes.</strong> Owner's Representatives, both internal and external, and the Owners Attorneys, could be at risk when they approve a substantive change to the Construction Contract that is not fully coordinated with the various terms and conditions of the Contract. A substantive change that is not fully coordinated may result in contradictions between Articles which in turn may cause overpayment and front end loading by the GC/CM for Insurance costs.</p>
    <p><strong>An example</strong> of what we have found Contractors Controlled Insurance Program (CCIP) 30 month schedule:</p>
    <ul id="audit-example">
      <li>Construction Cost<span>$100,000,000.00</span></li>
      <li>GC/CM Charge $38.00 per thousand<span>$3,800,000.00</span></li>
      <li>Estimated Actual $15.00 per thousand<span>$1,500,000.00</span></li>
      <li>Estimated Overcharge<span>$2,300,000.00</span></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When billed to Owner/Lender in the 1,2 or 3 Construction Billings FRONT END LOADED. Insurance Policy not purchased and paid for by GC/CM for 20 months.</p>
    <p>
    IT IS IN THE DETAIL COMPUTATION OF THIS COST and in the Contract or Owner Change Order</p>
    <p>What is often overlooked when an Owner/Lender has overpaid or has been a victim of front end loading is that he is also paying the GC/CM Fee in addition to paying Interest on the Construction Loan for those overpayments. As Owner Change Orders are approved and added to the costs, the overpayment increases.</p>
