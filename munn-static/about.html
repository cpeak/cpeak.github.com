      <p>Construction projects are among the largest and most complex financial expenditures undertaken. Our responsibility is to the owner! Audits identify actual and potential overpayments, overcharges, failures to recoup reimbursable expenses, etc. Our team of experts affords you the financial review of your construction project that your architect, engineer, accounting staff or project managers do not.</p>

This company is a successor to Jseph R Munn &amp; Associates. Mr. Munn was previously employed with Morse Diesel International and Metropolitan Stuctures, Inc., as Manager of Project Cost Accounting. When Mr. Munn left Morse Diesel International and Metropolitan Structures, he saw the need for construction cost accounting services for Owners, Construction Managers, General Contractors, Subcontractors and Suppliers.</p>
<p>Changes in the construction industry have made concepts such as partnering and alliances more important in assuring the viability of construction and construction related business.
