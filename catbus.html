  <h3>Mei &amp; the Cat Bus</h3>
  <p>My daughter was born on August 30th last year, and unfortunately we spent Halloween on the road on our way out to the east coast. It's now April and I've been tossing around ideas for her Halloween costume this year - it has to be awesome. It can't be anything over the top, it needs to be easy for her, simple to build, and safe. Since she will be 14 months in October, she should be upright and walking a little bit but not too mobile. We might use the stroller but my parents keep saying they want to get a Radio Flyer for her.</p>
  <p>The idea for this build originated around Star Wars - I had wanted to do a family costume involving myself, her, and my wife, but I couldn't really think of anything unique. Then the fan-made image of Calvin and Hobbes in their wagon made to look like Han &amp; Chewie in the Millenium Falcon popped in my head. I kicked around the idea of turning a Radio Flyer into the Falcon, but then do I dress her up as Han? It wasn't perfect. I struggled thinking of something unique that I hadn't seen before, where the little girl was the main character. Thats when it hit me - My Neighbor Totoro. Mai is a touch older than Alison, but her costume is simple - a red dress with a white shirt, and a yellow satchel. What about the wagon? The Cat Bus of course!</p>

  <p>The Cat Bus is going to be the difficult part, but not too hard. Using the Radio Flyer as a platform I can build a rough skeleton that just sits over it, with the cat's eight legs hanging down over the side covering the wheels. One tricky part is going to be the head - not only constructing it, but where does it go? As I am pulling Alison in the Cat Bus around, I have to use a large black handle out the front which has to move around, from straight up and down against the front to down on the ground if you let it go. I think I am going to build it backwards, having the face in all its grinning glory on the back where it can shine (hmm, as I write this - what about flash-light eyes like in the movie?), and I will hide the handle in the tail.</p>
  <p>I have the structure laid out in my head - an open top is going to be key, otherwise the whole thing will be way too tall and the proportions will be all off. I'll have mock windows down the sides, and the 'roofline' should be around shoulder height when she is sitting. Materials are going to be tough. Ive never worked with any kind of fake fur, so I think the easiest will be construction paper, but I want to spike fur or cloth first.</p>

  <p>Ill keep updating this page as the build comes along, but I have a hard completion date - it has to be done by October 30th. Time to get going!</p>
