    <h2>Share What You Learn</h2><p>Yesterday Darek asked for some help with an application he is writing, so we did a quick UI get together which actually was one of the best moments I have had at 8th Light thus far. To this point I have been rolling full-steam ahead on learning as much as I can and honing my craft. I have helped apprentices out here and there as well contributed during project iteration meetings, but nothing has really made me as happy as just banging out a UI and teaching the finer points of my craft and what I have learned so far.</p><p>We sat down and talked about an interface for a run-logging application he is working on, sketching out some ideas together. I explained how I look at designing a user interface as a workflow with beginning, middle, and end states, and try to envision how the flow of the app will work.  I shared a bit of my experience with him and even learned more about how developers tackle the same problem I would. Even though it was only 10 minutes, it made my day. I can't wait to see what he comes up with.</p>
