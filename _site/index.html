                    <h2>Well-Informed Improvisation</h2><p>In a few other posts I have readily admitted I love to tinker with things - I need to know how things work and what makes them tick. This past week I have done more reading and learning than any previous week of my residency.  I've spent an hour or so each night working on my Family Tree rails app and am really proud of what I have done on my own so far. Today I paired with Doug which was a fantastic experience, and I am also getting a new perspective now that I am working directly with Micah as my mentor. I have started asking more questions and collaborating with other residents as well as picking the brains of the craftsmen.</p><p>I read a lot of blogs &amp; articles about programming, design, video games, photography, education, and creativity in general and since I get a lot of time to think about things on the train each day I have been rather introspective this week regarding my residency, what I have learned, and my learning process in general. Im terrible at transitions, so here we go...</p><p>Rands in Repose has <a href='http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/05/09/two_universes.html'>an amazing blog post</a> on Portal and 'Sandboxed Learning' - I am a huge Portal fan so the article had an extra layer to the cake for me, so to speak. One quote stood out for me that I want to share: </p><div class='t_quote_block'> "Mastery is Well-Informed Improvisation"</div><p><em>Well-Informed Improvisation</em>. I love that. When I learn, I <strong>hate</strong> being given an answer or guided through a tutorial or spoon-fed what I supposedly should learn. Rands puts it more eloquently, but I believe that I will be the most successful if you give me a sandbox and tools, make it fun and interesting, and let me discover what I need to. To me that is exactly what my residency is all about! Apprenticeship is a journey of self-learning and discovery as much as it is working with a mentor.</p><p>I wanted to learn how to build a Rails application, and I wanted to learn how the tools worked and why. I took a look at the typical beginners 'build a blog in minutes' tutorials and they are all force-fed, watered-down step-by-step snooze-fests.  You run through the tutorials and yay, you can make a blog. Working through these you don't understand <em>what</em> scaffolding does and why, you don't get <em>what</em> controllers do, and so on. They shortcut a lot of fundamentals and gloss over the core functionality that you need to understand so when something goes wrong, you can work through the problem. My main goal isn't to be able to write a blog application (or even a family tree app). I want to learn the tools I have at hand to be able to design and build <strong>anything</strong> a client comes up with, to be able to communicate better with developers, and have a much better scope when estimating. So I thought of an app I wanted to write, and I started writing it. I setup the database, started writing code, reading about active records, making a few mistakes here and there, and learning a lot. It gave me the chance to tinker with settings just to see what the outcome would be - learning by the <em>baffle principle</em> (trademark pending).</p><h4>Baffle Principle?</h4><p><em>Huh? Baffles? What are you getting at?</em> So back in high school I took a few programming classes in Pascal and C++. One assignment was called <strong>Baffles</strong>. We had to program a game board that is hidden from the user, with randomly generated 'mirrors' or baffles laid out on different squares ( | \ and / ). The user would 'fire' a laser from one column or row, and the program would return which column or row the laser left the board. If it came into contact with a baffle it would deflect in a different direction, and could bounce off of multiple baffles. The object was for the user to shoot the laser from different points and guess which baffles were where. What does this have to do with anything? Apart from being a very fun assignment and letting me reminisce about turning in our assignments on 3.5" floppies, it is a great example of how I like to work and find a solution. I don't want to go from A to B to C. I want to be able to set the paramaters to manipulate the outcome so I can figure out the problem - I want to figure out where the baffles are.</p><p>So far this is how my residency has been - a lot of self learning, playing in the sandbox and mastering the tools of my trade while being mentored by master craftsmen who don't hover or feed me answers - they let me learn and I am extremely grateful for that.  My goal is to become a master at improvising and coming up with the best designs and solutions for my clients, setting the correct expectations, guiding them through the process and delivering premier results. With that I want to close with a quote from <a href='http://sandofsky.com/blog/shell-apps.html'>Benjamin Sandofsky</a></p><div class='t_quote_block'>"Great products require more work. They require commitment, attention to detail, and leaving your comfort zone. Shortcuts are just a distraction."</div><ul>

                    <h2>The Residency Continues...</h2><p>This past week was spent taking care of a bunch of little projects here and there - cross platform testing, a UI proposal, sketching and wire-framing to name a few. Now, I have always had a fascination with how things work and how to fix them, tearing apart electronics and even pulling the transmission out of my Jeep. Whenever I come across something mechanical or technical I need to know how it works and I wrestle with it until I figure it out. Working on our internal project I have been neck deep in Rails, and the more I work on it the more I want to get a grasp on the internals. I have also been looking for a good waza project for Friday afternoons.</p><p>This weekend I decided to kill a few birds with one stone (or is that a few pigs with one bird?). Over the last ten years I have been researching my family tree, tracing a good portion of it all the way back to the 1500s. However all of my research has been done the old fashioned way - pen and paper:</p><img alt='Family Tree' src='/images/tree.jpg' /><p>I have resorted to pen and paper because every piece of software out there that I have come across has been almost un-usable. So Sunday afternoon I put on Top Gear, fired up the laptop, sketched out my database tables and went to work. I was shocked - one episode later and I had a functional application up and running. I got a much better understanding of how Models and Controllers function on a technical level, as well as database interactions. Another episode later and it was in pretty good shape.  The only snag I ran into was date fields set as 0000-00-00 (ie, members who haven't died) crashed the app when I tried to format the date using <code>.to_s(:pretty)</code> which calls <code>time_formats.rb</code> initializer. There's one problem to solve later. The major hurdle is going to be formatting and displaying the actual tree itself - should be a very interesting design problem. I am also really interested in figuring out how to get the database table relations working, lots to do!</p>

                <div class='entry-content'>
                    <h2>Gettin' SASSy</h2><p>This past week I finally took the plunge into CSS pre-processing and started playing around with <a href='http://sass-lang.com/'>SASS</a>.  I've never been a huge fan of pre-processing - I like to be in complete control of what goes into my production level CSS files, but the whole point of my residency is to become a much more well-rounded developer and I want to have as many tools in my bag as I can. I have learned over the years that using the right tool for the job makes life a <em>lot</em> easier.</p><h3>What does it do?</h3><p>SASS allows you to use variables and nesting (among other things) in your CSS. Install the gem - <code>gem install sass</code>, create a new file called <strong>style.scss</strong>, and run: <code>sass --watch style.scss:style.css</code>. This translates <strong>style.scss</strong> file into a normal .css file, automatically updating whenever you edit the original. Now lets take a look at what we can do.</p><h4>Variables</h4><p>The .scss file is like a normal cascading style sheet, but much more flexible. Using the <a href='http://www.smacss.com'>SMACSS</a> approach we try to modularize our code the best we can, but there are times where we need to duplicate style calls. With SASS we can set variables which allows us to set global styles from <em>one</em> location. Setting <code>$var: #3366cc;</code> &amp; <code> $main_border: 1px solid #ccc;</code> allows us to use these styles anywhere in our stylesheet. In our style declaration,  set <code>$var</code> or <code>$main_border</code> and SASS will automatically translate it when it processes the .scss to .css</p><div class='l_overflow'>
<div class='m_code_block'><code> .foo { <br /> &emsp; border: $main_border; <br /> &emsp; color: $var; <br /> &emsp; ... <br />  }</code>
</div>
<div class='m_code_block'><code> .foo { <br /> &emsp; border: 1px solid #ccc; <br />  &emsp; color: #3366cc; <br /> &emsp; ... <br />}</code>
</div>
</div><h4>Nesting</h4><p>This also works for style nesting as well, which is a huge time-saver.  Lets see this in action:</p><div class='l_overflow'>
<div class='m_code_block'><code>
.foo {<br />
&emsp; border: $main_border; <br />
&emsp; li { <br />
&emsp; &emsp; color: $var;<br />
&emsp; &emsp; width: 100px;<br />
&emsp; &emsp; &amp;:hover { <br />
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; background-color: #f2f2f2;<br />
&emsp; &emsp; } <br /> 
&emsp; } 
</code>
</div>

<div class='m_code_block'><code>
.foo {<br />
&emsp; border: #3366cc; <br />
}  <br />
.foo li { <br />
&emsp; color: #3366cc;<br />
&emsp; width: 100px;<br />
} <br />
.foo li:hover { <br />
 &emsp; background-color: #f2f2f2;<br />
} 
</code>
</div>

</div><p>That's three separate style declarations bundled into one call in my .scss file.  This smooths out the workflow so I don't have to worry about breaking out each individual declaration, I can just define <code>.foo</code> and let the SASS handle the nitty gritty details.</p><h3>The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly</h3><p><strong>The Good:</strong> I like the fact that I can style an entire class in one fell swoop, I don't have to change mental gears and think of all the various declarations I need to cover. I can just go <code>.foo > styles > child > styles > states</code>. This is a great option for veteran developers who understand the fundementals of it and want to fast-track some of the more monotonous coding.</p><p><strong>The Bad:</strong> While I haven't developed a full project with it yet, I can see SASS hurting the practice of modularizing your CSS, and limiting semantic friendly markup.  A class chain might look like <code>&lt;div class="l_left m_foo m_bar"&gt;...&lt;div&gt;</code> (the div is has a layout class of left, is a  foo module as well as a bar module). Using the class chain method I can take a look at <code>.foo</code> and see &amp; change it's properties right from the html file itself. Heavily relying on SASS variables removes a level of semantics. <code>&lt;div class="foo"&gt;</code> doesn't tell me nearly as much as the previously mentioned class chain.</p><p><strong>The Ugly:</strong> What I like the least is the output of the SASS processing. The production .css file can sometimes be harder to read by humans. As a craftsman I want my production files to be easy to navigate - that way when either I, or another developer goes back into the code six months or a year later it's easy to understand.</p><h3>Overall</h3><p>I haven't actually used it in a production environment yet, and when I do I will share my experiences in another post. So far I have mixed feelings on it - I like the premise, but I have a control issue (ok, that ones on me) - that's why I still drive a Jeep with a manual transmission and no ABS, I like to be in total control. Variables, nesting, interpolation, operations - these are all things I want to get excited about and want to see in the official CSS spec, but right now they aren't. I will continue experimenting and sharing my thoughts -  To be continued...</p>
