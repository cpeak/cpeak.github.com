  <h2>Sorting out Position &amp; Z-Index Properties</h2>
  <p>One concept of web design that can trip up beginners and less-experienced developers is the <code>position</code> &amp; <code>z-index</code> properties.  CSS gives the designer flexibility to move elements around the page freely, and not just in two dimensions.  Using these two properties you can stack and layer divs so they flow above, below, and through each other. However when elements are positioned differently they are taken out of the normal flow of the document. Lets take a look</p>
  <h3>Position</h3>
  <p>The <code>position</code> property allows a div to break free from the normal flow of the layout. Typically elements are rendered in order and laid out according to their float &amp; margin properties.  Using a <code>fixed</code> or <code>absolute</code> position property, the element will ignore the normal document flow and behave depending on a different set of rules.</p>
  <h3>Position: Fixed</h3>
  <p>A div that is set to <code>position:fixed</code> will ignore the entire document flow, positioning itself only in relation to the view screen.  In other words it will remain in a fixed spot in the browser window irregardless of where the user scrolls to. How do we define where in the browser window the element will display? To do this we have to set the <code>top</code> and <code>left</code> properties in our CSS. For <code>&lt;div id="foo"&gt;</code> we can set <code>top: 10px;</code> and <code>left: 50px;</code> that way <code>foo</code> will display 10px from the top and 50px from the left, creating a static div that will remain in that location at all times. This can be advantageous for example if we have a page with a lot of text that the user must scroll through - when the user reaches the bottom the navigation is still at the top left, so they dont have to scroll all the way back to the top to move to a new page.</p>
  <h3>Position: Absolute</h3>
  <p>Here is where it gets a little tricky. Lets set <code>foo</code> to <code>position: absolute;</code>. Without changing anything else the div may not move at all.  A div with an <code>absolute</code> positioning will ignore the document flow, and position itself based on its <em>parent</em> div.  If div is sitting within the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> section it will float in the top left just as before.  However, if we move it into another section of the page it will relate itself to that particular parent element <em>only if that parent element has its position set to <code>relative</code>.</em> Wait a second, <code>relative</code>?  This is where a lot of people get confused. Setting a div to <code>relative</code> tells all its child elements to use itself to orient themselves when they are positioned absolutely. If you dont define the parent element the child will find the first container above it set to <code>relative</code> and position itself according to that. If you dont set your <code>absolute</code> and <code>relative</code> tags correctly, some strange thing will happen.</p>
  <h3>Z-Index</h3>
  <p>Just to further the complexity, lets take a look, at <code>z-index</code>.  This property allows us to stack our elements in 3 dimensions, just like an animator with multiple cells creating a layered effect, we can leverage it to create some interesting designs. If left un-defined any element will have a default <code>z-index</code> of 0. A div set to 10 will render above, and -10 will render below.  Combine this with the <code>position</code> property and your design is infinitely more flexible.</p>
  <h3>Bring it all together</h3>
  <p>You can go even <em>further</em> down the rabbit hole by throwing JQuery into the mix, dynamically changing <code>z-index</code> properties on the fly.  Just remember these are garnishes, if you start moving things around and re-stacking tons of elements things will probably start mis-behaving, or worse confuse your visitors. These are tools any good developer should have in their bag, but remember to <em>use the correct tool for the job</em>.</p>

  <h2>Music Theory and Web Design?</h2>
  <p>In my last post I discussed some practices I have been learning in order to clean up my HTML5 and CSS code on the back end.  This week I have been working on how to improve my typography, design, and layout using a grid based approach aided by the modular scale.</p>
  <h3>Modular Scale</h3>
  <p>The modular scale is a mathematical approach to layout design using ratios that are found in music. Thankfully my wife was a voice major in college so when I asked her about scales about it she gave me a long lecture on how they can evoke certain feelings or '<em>ethos</em>'.  If your goal is a more upbeat design then you may want to use a perfect-fourth which is a happier scale.  Conversely if you want a more serious and somber design, something like a minor-sixth might suit your needs. Now, how in the world do we apply music theory to web design? A scale is all based on the root note, whatever it may be.</p>
  <p>We take the ratios found in the scales and apply them to our root note or in our case, our base text size. Lets say our goal is to have a base text size of 16px - using a perfect fourth scale you get 16, 21, 28, 38, 50, 67, and so on. Now we can apply this to our design - our H1 tag will be at 67px, H2 50px, etc, back down to our root 16px text size. Not only do we use this for picking out our font-size's we can also use these numbers in our grid spacing.</p>
  <h3>Grid Based Layout</h3>
  <p>As a carpenter would you build a house without a level?  Sure you could frame the house and get everything together, but it wouldn't be anywhere near as good as it should be.  <a href='http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2007/04/14/designing-with-grid-based-approach/'>Smashing Magazine says it best</a>: <em>Your goal is to establish a consistent, logical screen layout, one that allows you to &quot;plug in&quot; text and graphics without having to stop and rethink your basic design approach on each new page.</em></p>
  <p>Using the <a href='http://www.hashgrid.com'>#Grid</a> JavaScript plugin I can toggle an overlay onto a site and see how the modules line up on the grid based layout. I re-visited my Tribune Article redesign project and used the perfect-fourth scale to determine column, gutter, and body width.  I knew I wanted a few more columns than usual in my layout due to the complexity of a news site and I was also limited in screen size to roughly 1000px.  Looking at our scale and crunching some numbers, I came up with a layout of 6 columns at 120px with gutters of 38px.  This gave us a total width of 948px.</p>
  <img src='/images/grid_layout.png' alt='Grid Based Layout' />
  <p>As you can see in the photo above, the main article uses roughly 3 columns, then a gutter, then the sidebar uses precisely 2. Now the layout has a much better and more consistent flow. The photo and caption sit nicely in the second and third column, and to create some tension I made sure the article didn't flow all the way over to the edge of the 3rd column.</p>
  <p>Just remember that these are guidelines and can be broken when necessary. Bending or breaking these rules create tension and unique design... just be careful when you stray from your scales .</p>
