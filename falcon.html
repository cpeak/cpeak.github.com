  <p>In November of 2023 I started work on the <a href="https://www.fanhome.com/us/star-wars/millenium-falcon" target="blank">Fanhome DeAgostini Millennium Falcon</a> model kit. It's a subscription based replica of the 3 foot filming &quot;miniature&quot; from <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>. The kit is spaced out over 100 issues, every month you get about 5 of them, so the whole build will take 2 years. Each issue comes with an assortment of parts and a small magazine - half of which is about Star Wars lore, and the other half is assembly instructions. The kit <i>is</i> painted, but nowhere near where it should be, so expect to do a full paint job on top of assembly.</p>

  <p>The first box is a great example tutorial of how the entire build will go - it contains a few small sections of the metal frame, the top turret hull piece, and pieces of the cockpit. This gives you a good idea of what kind of skills will be required for assembly.</p>

  <h2>December 31st, 2023</h2>

  <p>Assembly begings - I started with two small pieces of the upper frame - how do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time! It's going to be a long journey.</p>

  <p>The main living area interior is coming together nicely. There are actually upgrades you can get to replace the floor with actual metal grates, but I don't plan on displaying the full build with the top hull off looking inside, so I kept it stock. I did paint the flooring a bit darker, the original was a dull gray. I started practicing dry brushing on some of the science console details and the wall panels with some success. Going to need a lot more practice before I start doing exterior paints.</p>

  <p>Each issue has been coming with a few pieces of the lower frame, so things are taking shape. For your convenience the kit also comes with plastic shells that snap together  that you rest the kit on before everything is complete.</p>

  <h2>January 27th, 2025</h2>

  <p>Assembly continues, the lower frame is almost complete and the boarding ramp has been installed. I tested the ramp electronics and everything works great. I have to keep the wiring tucked away until further in the build process as the PCB board that sits in the rear of the model and battery pack haven't been installed yet.</p>

  <h2>February 16th, 2025</h2>

  <p>With the lower frame complete, the bottom hull panels are almost completely installed. The panels screw onto the metal frame so the entire thing feels extremly stiff.</p>

  <p>Once the hull was complete, some of the lower engine greeblies started going on. Some people could find this tedious, but I love putting on all the fine details - some of which were extremely tricky to get on. The thrust vector arms for the engine outlet don't go on until much later in the kit.</p>

  <h2>May 6th, 2025</h2>

  <p>The lower frame and hull complete for now, the top frame is now done with some of the hull installed. Notice the PCB for the electronics is installed in the lower frame, and the cutout in the top frame to see into the living area when you remove some of the top frame - a portion of the top hull is attached by magnets and snaps in place.</p>

  <h2>May 15th, 2025</h2>

  <p>The top hull panels are all in place, with the panel for the engine exhaust ports still not attached. I need to paint the maintenance pits and attach them to the hull at some point.</p>

  <h2>June 6th, 2025</h2>

  <p>The port side mandible is now assembled with the greeblies for the sides installed. The top maintenance pits are painted but still waiting on the greeblies for the top. One challenge was installing the headlight and snaking the wire through the mandible.</p>

  <h2>June 12th, 2025</h2>

  <p>A huge milestone is reached - first coat of paint on the hull is starting. The paint job on the kit from the factory is ... okay I guess. I call it &quot;smokers teeth yellow&quot;, and the details aren't realistic at all, notice the blaster marks by the rectenna, they're just dots. Once the base coat is on I will have to go in with a dremel to add some detail and then airbrush in realistic blast marks. Also I can't wait to get rid of that horrid yellow panel on the base of the blaster turret.</p>
