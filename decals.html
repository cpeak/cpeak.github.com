    <p>Okay, so you got a fancy pack of decals and want to plaster em all over the office, but how do you do it correctly? Its rather easy and I'm guessing you could figure it out yourself, but hey, help is always a good thing.</p>
    <p>What you're going to need:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Windex</li>
      <li>Paper Towels</li>
      <li>A dry erase marker helps (not necessary)</li>
      <li>Tape measure</li>
      <li>Good eyes</li>
      <li>Squeegee, credit card, or something similar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>First thing to figure out is where you're going to place the decals around the office. For all the room names in Chicago I used a baseline of 60" off the bottom sill of the floor-to-ceiling windows, 3" from the door jam. You want to be sure all the decals are placed along the same horizontal plane, and in the same place in the window (im assuming center).
    <p>Once you've determined your baseline and cleaned the area with Windex, mark it with the dry erase marker about an 1/8th of an inch below - you don't want to apply the decal over dry erase marker because then you'd see it from the backside of the glass.</p>
    <p>Place the decal face down on a flat surface, and gently peel off the backing sheet, ensuring the decal sticks to the clear transfer tape. I find its nice to peel it completely over 180&deg; slowly, instead of just peeling it straight up. With the larger decals this should be pretty easy, its the smaller decals with little details you have to be extra careful with.</p>
    <p>You should now have the decal on the transfer tape with no backing. Try your hardest not to touch the decal, don't want any grease from your hand on the back. This is the trickiest part - applying it to the window. Hold it stead and sloooooooowly place it on the glass. As the transfer tape gets close sometimes static electricity will pull it to the glass (not often but enough to warrant me telling you about it). Do not press down. If you are not level you may still have a chance to pull it back and re-apply it. Stand back and eyeball it, see if it looks level.</p>
    <p>If it's not level try to peel it off and re-apply it (may be very difficult). Once it is level and on the glass, start rubbing it down with a squeegee or credit card. Press firmly and work from the center outwards to get any air pockets out. After that, grab one corner of the transfer tape and like before start peeling it away making sure the decal stays on the glass, not the tape. Peel it over 180&deg; slowly.</p>
    <p>Once the tape is off, hit it again with your squeegee, then stand back and admire your work. Pray you didn't mis-align anything because once its on there its on. Clean the glass again with some Windex and you are good to go!</p>
    <p>Last but not least take a pic and drop it in Slack</p>
