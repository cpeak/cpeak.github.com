      <li><code>Learning from and with a community can be an important part of making progress.</code> I have joined the Midwest Design Chat Slack channel, and am on the waitlist for Designer Hangout UX Community. Additionally I have signed up for the CSS Weekly newsletter, MailChimp's UX newsletter, and two other CSS3 technical mailing lists.</li>
      <li><code>Review your accountability partners' lists of goals, and give them feedback directly (no need to broadcast).</code></li>

      <li><code>This week, track your steps toward each incremental goal you set for yourself.</code></li>
      <li><code>Give your accountability groups [direct, empathetic] feedback on their incremental goals.</code></li>
      <li><code>What are some daily/weekly habits you can build (or reinforce) that will help you in achieving your goals?</code> Considering this is a week late, I obviously need to do something. I now have both a Calendar reminder and a Slackbot reminder to make sure I am at least learning one thing or applying what I am learning to my side project.</li>

    <ol>
      <li><code>Have you been sticking to your daily habit that you identified last week?</code> Yes and no, catching up on all this now. With my daily reminders set I think I should be able to stay on track now. I have started interacting in my Slack channel, introducing myself and starting to get involved a little bit.</li>
      <li><code>Review your progress towards your goals, and if applicable, write down how your goals are changing or focusing.</code> Goals are not changing, but my reminders are set, and I am now making progress. I have <a href="/css3-grid" class="underlined">setup a project for applying what I am learning</a> using real world examples, not just squares on a page.</li>

  <div class="content-wrap">
    <ol>
      <li><code>What did you get done towards your goals last week? Be specific.</code> Two major things - first I took a good deep dive into the basics of Grids and how the basic syntax structure works. Broke a few things, but learned a lot. I also kick-started the Slack channel I joined. Apparently it was pretty dead for a week or two, so I introduced myself and started some conversations going. Without specifically saying so I have started morning standup with them, asking open ended questions every morning. The channel is going pretty well now.

      </li>
      <li><code>Check up on your accountability group and encourage them!</code></li>
      <li><code>Which of your goals seems closest to completion? Which is furthest from being done?</code> Closest? Maybe giving a Zagaku on the fundamentals of grid based design with some CSS3. Farthest would be the project - I want to make a real life landing page for something. Right now I'm still on the floating panels portion.</li>

    <ol>
      <li><code>What did you get done towards your goals last week? Be specific.</code> Getting caught up after vacation, starting to dive back into code. Also started scaffolding out two Zagakus I could give in a month or two.</li>
      <li><code>Check up on your accountability group and encourage them!</code></li>
      <li><code>How are your daily habits going? Is it time to expand that habit to something very slightly more ambitious?</code> Vacation seems to have kinda thrown me off a little bit, but getting back into the routine.</li>
