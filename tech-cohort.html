    <ol>
      <li><code>Learning from and with a community can be an important part of making progress.</code> I have joined the Midwest Design Chat Slack channel, and am on the waitlist for Designer Hangout UX Community. Additionally I have signed up for the CSS Weekly newsletter, MailChimp's UX newsletter, and two other CSS3 technical mailing lists.</li>
      <li><code>Review your accountability partners' lists of goals, and give them feedback directly (no need to broadcast).</code></li>
      <li>
        <code>Determine some intermediate steps towards your goals.</code>
        <ul class="bullet-list">
          <li>Create basic project for CSS3 Grid sandbox</li>
          <li>Review 2 blog posts covering Grids</li>

  <div class="content-wrap">
    <ol>
      <li><code>This week, track your steps toward each incremental goal you set for yourself.</code></li>
      <li><code>Give your accountability groups [direct, empathetic] feedback on their incremental goals.</code></li>
      <li><code>What are some daily/weekly habits you can build (or reinforce) that will help you in achieving your goals?</code> Considering this is a week late, I obviously need to do something. I now have both a Calendar reminder and a Slackbot reminder to make sure I am at least learning one thing or applying what I am learning to my side project.</li>

  <h3 class="module-title">Assignment 4<span>07/10/2017</span></h3>
  <div class="content-wrap">
    <ol>
      <li><code>Have you been sticking to your daily habit that you identified last week?</code> Yes and no, catching up on all this now. With my daily reminders set I think I should be able to stay on track now. I have started interacting in my Slack channel, introducing myself and starting to get involved a little bit.</li>
      <li><code>Review your progress towards your goals, and if applicable, write down how your goals are changing or focusing.</code> Goals are not changing, but my reminders are set, and I am now making progress. I have <a href="/css3-grid" class="underlined">setup a project for applying what I am learning</a> using real world examples, not just squares on a page.</li>
      <li><code>Give your accountability group [direct, empathetic] feedback on their Assignment #3 responses &amp; progress.</code></li>
