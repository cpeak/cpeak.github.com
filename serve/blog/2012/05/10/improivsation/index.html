  <h2>Well-Informed Improvisation</h2><p>In a few other posts I have readily admitted I love to tinker with things - I need to know how things work and what makes them tick. This past week I have done more reading and learning than any previous week of my residency.  I've spent an hour or so each night working on my Family Tree rails app and am really proud of what I have done on my own so far. Today I paired with Doug which was a fantastic experience, and I am also getting a new perspective now that I am working directly with Micah as my mentor. I have started asking more questions and collaborating with other residents as well as picking the brains of the craftsmen.</p><p>I read a lot of blogs &amp; articles about programming, design, video games, photography, education, and creativity in general and since I get a lot of time to think about things on the train each day I have been rather introspective this week regarding my residency, what I have learned, and my learning process in general. Im terrible at transitions, so here we go...</p><p>Rands in Repose has <a href='http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2012/05/09/two_universes.html'>an amazing blog post</a> on Portal and 'Sandboxed Learning' - I am a huge Portal fan so the article had an extra layer to the cake for me, so to speak. One quote stood out for me that I want to share: </p><div class='t_quote_block'> "Mastery is Well-Informed Improvisation"</div><p><em>Well-Informed Improvisation</em>. I love that. When I learn, I <strong>hate</strong> being given an answer or guided through a tutorial or spoon-fed what I supposedly should learn. Rands puts it more eloquently, but I believe that I will be the most successful if you give me a sandbox and tools, make it fun and interesting, and let me discover what I need to. To me that is exactly what my residency is all about! Apprenticeship is a journey of self-learning and discovery as much as it is working with a mentor.</p><p>I wanted to learn how to build a Rails application, and I wanted to learn how the tools worked and why. I took a look at the typical beginners 'build a blog in minutes' tutorials and they are all force-fed, watered-down step-by-step snooze-fests.  You run through the tutorials and yay, you can make a blog. Working through these you don't understand <em>what</em> scaffolding does and why, you don't get <em>what</em> controllers do, and so on. They shortcut a lot of fundamentals and gloss over the core functionality that you need to understand so when something goes wrong, you can work through the problem. My main goal isn't to be able to write a blog application (or even a family tree app). I want to learn the tools I have at hand to be able to design and build <strong>anything</strong> a client comes up with, to be able to communicate better with developers, and have a much better scope when estimating. So I thought of an app I wanted to write, and I started writing it. I setup the database, started writing code, reading about active records, making a few mistakes here and there, and learning a lot. It gave me the chance to tinker with settings just to see what the outcome would be - learning by the <em>baffle principle</em> (trademark pending).</p><h4>Baffle Principle?</h4><p><em>Huh? Baffles? What are you getting at?</em> So back in high school I took a few programming classes in Pascal and C++. One assignment was called <strong>Baffles</strong>. We had to program a game board that is hidden from the user, with randomly generated 'mirrors' or baffles laid out on different squares ( | \ and / ). The user would 'fire' a laser from one column or row, and the program would return which column or row the laser left the board. If it came into contact with a baffle it would deflect in a different direction, and could bounce off of multiple baffles. The object was for the user to shoot the laser from different points and guess which baffles were where. What does this have to do with anything? Apart from being a very fun assignment and letting me reminisce about turning in our assignments on 3.5" floppies, it is a great example of how I like to work and find a solution. I don't want to go from A to B to C. I want to be able to set the paramaters to manipulate the outcome so I can figure out the problem - I want to figure out where the baffles are.</p><p>So far this is how my residency has been - a lot of self learning, playing in the sandbox and mastering the tools of my trade while being mentored by master craftsmen who don't hover or feed me answers - they let me learn and I am extremely grateful for that.  My goal is to become a master at improvising and coming up with the best designs and solutions for my clients, setting the correct expectations, guiding them through the process and delivering premier results. With that I want to close with a quote from <a href='http://sandofsky.com/blog/shell-apps.html'>Benjamin Sandofsky</a></p><div class='t_quote_block'>"Great products require more work. They require commitment, attention to detail, and leaving your comfort zone. Shortcuts are just a distraction."</div><ul>
