  <h2>Pairing Tour - Part 1</h2><p>I am now halfway through my Pairing Tour this week, which has given me the chance to follow along with different craftsmen working on various projects in order to get whole lot more experience very quickly.  So far it has been a lot of fun and very challenging, especially since I am a UX/UI Designer working with developers. A few times during the week it has felt like I've taken Italian 101 &amp; 102, and then decided to sit in on a lecture on Italian Literature of the 16th century. Thankfully I can keep up, but there's no way Im going to pass the final.</p><h4>Day 1</h4><p>Monday I paired with Wai-Lee at a clients office which let me see how a much larger project works when stories are broken out into different teams and conflicts arise. A small chicken &amp; the egg situation came up in the morning so there was a lot of discussions about how to tackle various problems involved with it.  There were some disagreements on how some things should be implemented but a scrum in the conference room took care of it - communication was key and work didn't get hung up. I got to see how much is involved in Test Driven Design &amp; how important it is to delivering a quality product, as well as a much closer look into the bowels of MVC Architecture. I was also very pleased to see that there were no ego's involved - discussions were on topic and to the point, issues were resolved and things kept flowing.</p><h4>Day 2</h4><p>Tuesday I travelled up to Libertyville to spend the day with Colin working on another big client. The morning was spent diagnosing an issue with user profiles and status updates in a very complex system. He walked me through what the issue was, explained a script he had written to resolve it, but he wanted to know <i>why</i> the issue came up in the first place.  I very much enjoyed going through the problem solving motions with him, it was another great learning experience.</p><p>In the afternoon he gave me a simple one-page site he had been working on and wanted to see what I could do to improve it. He let me run with it and show what I could do. It was very comforting to know I can just switch gears on the fly and use the skills I have been honing with such ease. I dove in and started cleaning up the markup, commenting and documenting as much as I could.  I cleaned up the spacing and layout of the page using a grid based approach with the modular scale, giving the page a much more solid feel while letting the text breathe and flow better. It wasn't a major overhaul by any means, but as I explained to Colin, a 'good tune-up'.</p><h4>The Story So Far</h4><p>This week has been a great experience so far - I followed along with Doug &amp; Micah before, and now Wai-Lee &amp; Colin. I have learned a lot and can't wait to finish up the week with Kevin and Mike.  I think the most important lesson thus far has been getting a better feel for what a developer does day to day and what exactly is involved in implementing stories. As a designer I never want to assume how much work a feature I want will be to code - I don't want to blindly say 'Oh, well can't you just...' and throw them under the bus and let them figure it out.</p><p>Pairing with different developers allows me to communicate with them even better than before. I can look at a UI sketch and realize how much work will be involved in getting it working. While I won't be estimating any back-end stories with them at least I know if I am about to drop a 10+ point story on them so I can buy them lunch later to get back on their good side.</p>
