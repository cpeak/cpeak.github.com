    <p>I pride myself as being able to step into legacy codebases without previous exposure and almost immediately start delivering work. Having both freelanced and consulted for over a decade I have seen, touched, written in, and worked on more systems than I can count. I am comfortable working from small marketing sites to full-on enterprise level applications. It's not often you find a designer who uses VIM on a daily basis.</p>
    <p>Additionally I enjoy UX Design, UI Design, Branding, and Illustration. I am proficient in Sketch.app, Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign.</p>
    <p>When I'm not working I enjoy <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com/" target="blank">photography</a>, astronomy, hiking, and spending time with my family.</p>
