  <h1 class="section-title">About</h1>
  <p>Where others see problems, I see opportunities. I am a Principal Designer at 8th Light - an experienced UI/UX designer who proudly advocates for users, creating simple, accessible, elegant, and functional websites &amp; applications. I've been with 8th Light for over thirteen years, and in the industry for close to twenty.</p>
  <p>I fell in love with computers at an early age - fiddling with BASIC on my dad's Apple II, learning Pascal and C++ in High School, and then moving on to HTML &amp; CSS which better suited my interests. As the web matured I kept up with the technologies, learning SCSS, Javascript, JQuery, and eventually modern tools like Angular and React. It's not every day that you meet a designer who uses VIM.</p>
  <p>I've been lucky enough to work on a wide array of projects - from small startups &amp; non-profits, to major insurance companies, law firms, a globally recognized art museum, and multiple Fortune 100's. I am comfortable working in legacy codebases or greenfield, running human centered design workshops, wireframing new features, doing user interviews, and much more.</p>
  <p>When I'm not working I enjoy <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com/" target="blank">photography</a>, astronomy, hiking, <a href="/recumbent-biking">riding my recumbent bike</a>, playing my Gretsch, and spending time with my family.</p>
