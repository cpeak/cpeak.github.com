  <h1 class="section-title">About</h1>
  <p>Where others see challenges, I see opportunities. As a Principal Designer at 8th Light with nearly 20 years of experience, I specialize in creating intuitive, accessible, and elegant digital experiences. For over thirteen years at 8th Light, I've passionately advocated for users, designing functional websites and applications that put their needs first.</p>

  <p>My journey with computers began at an early age—starting with BASIC on my dad's Apple II, progressing through Pascal and C++, and eventually discovering a love for HTML and CSS. As the web evolved, so did I, mastering technologies like SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and modern frameworks like Angular and React. It's not every day that you meet a designer who uses VIM.</p>

  <p>Throughout my career, I've had the privilege of working on a diverse range of projects—from startups and non-profits to Fortune 100 companies, major law firms, global museums, and everything in between. Whether working with legacy systems or greenfield projects, I thrive in environments where I can lead human-centered design workshops, conduct user research, wireframe new features, and more.</p>

  <p>When I'm not working I enjoy <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com/" target="blank">photography</a>, <a href="/millennium-falcon">model building</a>, hiking, <a href="/recumbent-biking">riding my recumbent bike</a>, playing my Gretsch, and spending time with my family.</p>
