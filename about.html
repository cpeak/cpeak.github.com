<h2>About</h2>
<img class="l_left l_portrait" src="/images/me.png" alt="Chris" /><p>My name is Chris Peak and I am a design resident at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a> in Chicago, IL. I have been doing web development and graphic design for the better part of 10 years. My interest in computers started when I was tall enough to reach my dads Apple II, but my professional growth started when I wanted to create a website for my growing photography portfolio <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com">Gorilla-Studios</a> in 2003. I worked as an Soda Jerk, Bartender, then an IT Technician for number of years before coming to 8th Light.</p>
<p>This blog is about my journey and experiences in web design and development.
When I am not writing long-winded blog posts and staring at code all day I love photography, relaxing with my lovely wife, learning to juggle, and playing the guitar very poorly.</p>
