<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Chris Peak and I am a Design Craftsman at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a> in Chicago, IL. I have been doing web development and graphic design for the better part of 15 years. My interest in computers started when I was tall enough to reach my dads Apple II, but my professional growth started when I created a website for my photography portfolio <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com">Gorilla-Studios</a> in 2003, as well as free-lancing various projects over the last decade.</p>
<p>This blog was originally created as a weekly assignment during my apprenticeship allowing me to share my experiences on my journey to becoming a craftsman, teaching what I have learned and giving back to the software community. Now it is more of a personal blog dedicated to design, software, personal experiences, and things I may find interesting along the way.</p>
<p>When I am not writing long-winded blog posts and staring at code all day I love relaxing with my awesome wife, taking long photography walks, slowly getting better at juggling, and playing the guitar very poorly.</p>
