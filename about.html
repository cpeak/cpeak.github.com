<h2>About</h2>
<img class="l_left l_portrait" src="/images/me.png" alt="Chris" /><p>My name is Chris Peak and I am a design resident at <a href="http://www.8thlight.com">8th Light</a> in Chicago, IL. This blog is about my journey and experiences in web design and development.
When I am not writing long-winded blog posts and staring at code all day I love sharing my photography and experience on my own site <a href="http://www.gorilla-studios.com">Gorilla-Studios</a>, relaxing with my lovely wife, learning to juggle, and playing the guitar very poorly.</p>
