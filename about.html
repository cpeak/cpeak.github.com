<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Chris Peak and I am a design resident at 8th Light in Chicago, IL, working hard to become a full-time craftsman. This blog is about my journey and experiences in web design and development.
When I am not writing long-winded blog posts and staring at code all day I love sharing my photography and experience on my own site Gorilla-Studios, relaxing with my lovely wife, learning to juggle, and playing the guitar very poorly.</p>
