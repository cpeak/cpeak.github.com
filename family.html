    <p>Hello family! We're doing well down here in Yorkville enjoying the house. Alison is thriving in 4th grade and Emma is enjoying her second year in Montessori before heading off to Kindergarten! I'm about to hit 12 years at 8th Light, so needless to say I'm enjoying my job. I've been working from home since 2018, so that takes a lot of stress off me.</p>
    <p>We're looking to a fun and adventerous 2024, with the Eclipse, another Connecticut trip this summer, and lots more planned. Hope to see you all soon!</p>
