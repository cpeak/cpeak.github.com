    <p>As a kid growing up in the 1980's, my bike gave me my first taste of freedom. It opened up my world from just my street to my neighborhood and beyond. I could ride around all day, wherever I wanted, as long as I was home when it got dark (it was a different time). As I grew up (literally in this case) normal bikes just didn't fit right and became pretty uncomfortable. When I was a Sophomore in high school I kept growing, topping out at 6'6", so my department store mountain bike just wasn't cutting it anymore and some of the magic had worn off.</p>
